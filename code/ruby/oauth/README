This is a semi-functional implementation of authenticating using OAuth and Kiva in Ruby.

This code in particular is used in a Redmine plugin to authenticate Kiva users.

There are several dependencies including needing to properly setup your database to handle token storage for OAuth 1.0a

NOTE: This example will not work for you out of the box, you will need to tailor it to your app, but I hope this will be a good starting point for developers who want to use Ruby & OAuth & Kiva.

Pull requests happily accepted.
