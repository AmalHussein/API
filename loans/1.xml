He started by buying and selling of goats right away. Most butchers have known his business, so a number of them come to him to buy goats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can now buy and sell between 15 and 20 goats in a month -- a great amount.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The market is very open since most of Ugandans rear goats and cows for raising money whenever needs arise like school fees, sickness, death, journey etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;O. has attended business training and he is capable of handling the loan and paying it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given a loan of 500 US dollars, he is targeting to introduce bulls for slaughter and opening up a butcher shop himself. </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>241</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Butcher Shop</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy bulls, open a butcher shop</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Tororo</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.75 34.083333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>1</partner_id><posted_date>2005-04-15T17:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Justine</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2005-04-19T13:19:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2010-06-29T01:11:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8</payment_id><comment>This group made the first effort to make the payment of the loan money by giving 51,000 Ugandan Shillings that is equivalent to $30.

He plans to use the loan money for increasing the quantity of the essential commodities in his shop e.g.  Sugar, bar soap, salt, tea leaves, cooking oil, soap in powder form for washing (OMO) and for bathing, posho, beans etc.  With the loan money, this bussiness will increase the quantity of the goods that they will stock in the shop.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;This is a very special bussiness to the people of the community. Instead of people in the community riding their bicycles for 15 Kilometres going out to Tororo town to buy some of essential commodities for their famillies for home use,this bussiness now does the job for them.  This bussiness is now providing the sevice to the people within the community by providing all their basic needs in the

He got some profits and decided to divert to a drug shop business (buying and selling of human medicines).&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;This business is special in that it deals in the human medicine and is located in the village.  Today, so many people are sick in the community such that the small health centers in the villages doesen&apos;t have enough medicine to give out to the patients.  Most medical personels just recommend their patients to go and buy medicine in private drug shops, for the Govornment really stocks medicine in the rural heath centres.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;But this bussiness is strategically placed deep in the rural area.  Given a loan of $500, Simon plans to increase the stock by buying more medicines that is not in his stock and yet it is very much needed by the patients in the village.  This will make this bussiness to earn more profit to pay the loan and increse the stock.This will fetch him enough money and profit that can help him in his family and refund of the loan.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;He attended training on business skills organized by VEF and is very capable of using this loan well and repaying it in full.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>264</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pharmacy</activity><sector>Health</sector><use>Buying of medicine for rural drug shop</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Soroti</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>1.583333 33.583333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>1</partner_id><posted_date>2005-10-15T17:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Simon</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2005-11-10T07:10:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>83</payment_id><comment>This business has started receiving some profit from their sells.&#13;&#10;They have started refunding the loan by paying $50.&#13;&#10;Thanks alot for supporting this business.&#13;&#10;Moses.</comment></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2006-03-03T15:11:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>135</payment_id><comment>There was a general complaint from all the businesses that the campaigns of the resent presidential election affected the businesses very much.&#13;&#10;People lived in fear to do their normal activities as the government soldiers were deployed all over the villages all round Uganda.&#13;&#10;The businesses are just picking up since the country has remain peaceful.&#13;&#10;For this reason, this business has managed to make a payment of $30 for the loan refund.&#13;&#10;The business opportunity is now high since all the people have gone back to their usual business.&#13;&#10;Thanks alot for funding this business.&#13;&#10;Moses.</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2006-06-26T16:49:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>496</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2006-08-11T14:33:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>771</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2006-10-16T06:42:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>1585</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>120</amount><local_amount>120</local_amount><processed_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>120</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>1935</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2006-10-24T05:07:52Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>9</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>103</id><name>Anonymous</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en/></texts></description><status>defaulted</status><funded_amount>2000</funded_amount><image><id>726677</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Buying improved breeds (heifers) of cattle for milk and milk products -

She started with a small business of selling greens, tomatoes, onions and cooking oil.  Her business continued well for a period of eight months as she realized some profits.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Now, she is going to do a used clothing business. She is going to buy clothes in big quantities and then she will sell to the local people in the Mulanda market.  She goes to Kampala to buy the clothes, they are less expensive in Kampala.  This trip is around 300 KM each way and she takes a bus.  The bus ride charges 18,000 shilling for the round trip and 2,000 shillings for each bell.  She intends to buy 4 on each trip.  This means that the transportation costs her around $30 US in total.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After selling all 4 bells of clothes, the approximate profit is about $200 US dollars, so this is a very good business to be in right now in Uganda.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;These clothes are in many varieties.  Skirt and blouse, t-shirts from america.  Such T-shirts are pure cotton with pictures of American things --  University of Minnesota, Florida, baseball and football teams.  They come in many varieties.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She is capable to handle the loan and to pay it back promptly.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>279</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Buy bells of used cloths</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Tororo</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.75 34.083333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>1</partner_id><posted_date>2005-10-15T17:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lydia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>300</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2006-01-05T05:53:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>117</payment_id><comment>This business has worked very hard to raise money for the growth of the business and repayment of the loan.&#13;&#10;Chrismas time was a wonderful moment of time to this business because of high demand of their commodities in the community.&#13;&#10;They have payed $50 as first installment to reduce their loan money.&#13;&#10;More about this business will come in the next journal.&#13;&#10;Please have time to read about this business in the Journal that will be coming soon.&#13;&#10;Thanks alot for supporting this business with loan money to enable them come above poverty level.&#13;&#10;Thanks.</comment></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2006-03-03T15:20:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>146</payment_id><comment>There was a general complaint from all the businesses that the campaigns of the resent presidential election affected the businesses very much.&#13;&#10;People lived in fear to do their normal activities as the government soldiers were deployed all over the villages all round Uganda.&#13;&#10;The businesses are just picking up since the country has remain peaceful.&#13;&#10;For this reason, this business has managed to make a payment of $30 for the loan refund.&#13;&#10;The business opportunity is now high since all the people have gone back to their usual business.&#13;&#10;Thanks alot for funding this business.&#13;&#10;Moses.</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2006-06-26T17:02:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>508</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2006-08-11T14:37:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>775</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>60</amount><local_amount>60</local_amount><processed_date>2006-10-16T06:50:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>60</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>1589</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2006-11-07T10:25:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>2133</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2006-11-07T10:25:49Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>8</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>116</id><name>Eseza</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Eseza is a widow with nine children.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She has sold in retail for quite 4 years.

Meru has a small staff and it has been observed that they are a very successful  team and that is why they now qualify for this loan from Kiva.  &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The used clothing business is very successful in Tanzania, as it is in all of East Africa.  Many East Africans have found great use for used clothing from Europe and America.  It is less expensive than African clothing and of pretty high quality.  Thus, you can see many Tanzanias walking around wearing t-shirts displaying American brands, schools, regions, performers and sports teams.  This is just a reality here.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The loan will expand the business by openning a small shop for selling more clothes also she will be able to go to Dar-es-salaam to buy stock for the business and the business.  The ability to travel this far will set them apart here in Dodoma, for most locals do not have the opportunity to make such a long voyage for business.  This will allow them to buy the clothes as they come straight into the country from foreign lands.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>296</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To buy bells of used clothing</use><location><country_code>TZ</country_code><country>Tanzania</country><town>Dodoma</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-6.183333 35.75</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>1</partner_id><posted_date>2005-11-15T18:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Meru</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2006-03-11T18:26:51Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>169</payment_id><comment/></payment><payment><amount>230</amount><local_amount>230</local_amount><processed_date>2006-06-07T09:36:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>230</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>408</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2006-08-29T20:08:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>1028</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>170</amount><local_amount>170</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>170</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>4446</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-01-14T21:29:13Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>3</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>128</id><name>Agatha</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;i&gt;This description was written by Richard Mazengo, a staff member for Village Enterprise Fund in Tanzania.

The local tailors keep the African styles alive.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;This business started with one sewing machine and now they have three more that they have bought from their profits.  She is training  others from out side the group on how to start their own tailoring business. The loan will help the business to grow and make more profit.

Uganda&lt;/i&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Village Enterprise Fund (VEF) donated 100$ grant to her in the year 1998. She started with a small business of tomatoes selling and onions. Her business went on well for a period of one year and she was realizing good profits.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In 2000, VEF organized a business training course for all the beneficiaries. She happen to be lucky to be one of the participants in the training.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She was able to learn a lot in a housing profitable business, marketing, book keeping and business strategies. She then divided to&#13;&#10;change to another business of produce selling.&#13;&#10;Here she has got better market where by her business is doing well and it has enabled her to buy a lot of produce and feeding together with&#13;&#10;education of her Children.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The new produce is got from or bought at the rural markets deep in the rural communities.  In most cases she buys directly from the farmers who bring their produce in small quantities and sell using cups or basins. These farmers are found in deep rural areas far a way from town. Most farmers grow produce like goundnuts, millet, beans and others in very small scale on individual home basis their are no farms.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of US $500 She will be capable of doing so well in her business by expanding her stock and also to meet the high demand of produce in the area.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Being a wife with a vision for the family, I know she will be greatly be helped to develop her

She then decided to change her business to opening a restaurant.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Here she got a lot of customers where by the profit her business were so good which enabled her to buy and cook a lot of food in her restaurant to meet the increasing number of customers.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;When she just started she used to do the cooking, but now days she has four girls and one boy helping her in her restaurant to cook and serve the customers as she supervises.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The kind of restaurant Agnes is operating is not very large, but itâ€™s a restaurant that has all the dishes enjoyed by the people in the area prepared in the standard liked by the people or customers of her restaurant.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She prepares dishes like groundnuts pasted meat stew, fried chicken, roasted chicken, rice, posho, beans, greens and the local breadÂ  made of millet or sorghum.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She has a small sign post on the road side and now many people know her and call her doctor hunger.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Because of the good foods she cooks, the fair prices she offers, and the newly acquired name to her, every body knows her by name and have made known the restaurant in the whole

Bulgaria&lt;/i&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Zara I. works in Sliven, Bulgaria.  She has run her own tailoring shop in the center of the town for the past three years, and lives in a small village on the outskirts of town with her husband and two small children.  She mends and makes simple clothes for people in the neighborhood. However, her primary sewing machine has become unreliable and she does not have the financial ability to purchase a new one.  &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;With this loan, she plans to do two things.  First, she will purchase a new sewing machine.  Secondly, she will fix up the back of her store where people will be able to try on the clothes she alters or makes for them.  The flexibility of the Kiva loan has special significance for Zara, given her familyâ€™s situation.  Her husband, who has been unable to find outside employment, tends to the familyâ€™s garden, the produce of which will be sold in the summer of 2006.  With a portion of the proceeds from the harvest, she plans to repay the majority of the loan principal, the remainder of which will be repaid in the early fall of 2006 out of the cash flow of her business.

This group of 33 will each receive $25 to plant their own share of crops. They will share the risk of the loan together with a representative being responsible for delivering the repayments.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Since this is an agricultural loan, it will be repaid in its entirety at the end of the growing season rather than in installments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louly Ngogom is a village of about 500 inhabitants of the Serrer ethnic group, under the leadership of Doudou D., the resident local government counsel member. Located among majestic baobab trees about 20 miles inland from the beach resort area of Mbour, Louly Ngokom is a poor village that depends on its youth in the cities to send money and rice home in the hungry months of August and September. In the summer of 2004, villagers lacked capital to buy seeds to plant their main cash crop, peanuts. For the initial lending, 15 household heads were chosen by Doudou and a counsel of village elders to receive a loan of $25 each to purchase of seeds before the planting season. After the harvest, 99.5% reimbursed the loans with an interest rate of 6%. In 2005, with continuing donations through John Fay, GENSEN and the village counsel were able to increase the loan and the number of beneficiaries to 33 persons, 17 men and 16 women selected on a rotating basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its goal of becoming a self-sufficient model village, Louly has in its favor a partnership with a new modern ecovillage group, introduced with the facilitation of the GENSEN NGO, SOS Environment. In fact, the ecovillage of Louly Ngokom consists of the existing traditional inhabitants plus this new group of about 20 incoming settlers, who already have started to employ local youth to grow organic bananas and produce and to construct modern ecological dwellings. </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>318</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farm Supplies</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>33 individual loans of $25 to purchase seeds for cash crop - peanuts</use><location><country_code>SN</country_code><country>Senegal</country><town>Louly Ngogom</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>14.7333 -16.4167</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>4</partner_id><posted_date>2006-02-15T18:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Doudou</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>825</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>825</amount><local_amount>825</local_amount><processed_date>2006-12-07T21:43:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-12-07T21:43:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>825</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>2904</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2006-12-07T21:43:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>6</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>153</id><name>Khadyjatou</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;em&gt;This is a group loan where 20 people get $70 loans and share the risk.

Located in the mouth of the Casamance River, Carabane is an off-shore island village with 700 year-round inhabitants. As the entry point of French rule in the Casamance Region of Senegal, and a classic mangrove ecosystem, Carabane is a natural ecotourist destination. However, tourism alone, as currently practiced, is insufficient to provide all the needs of the villagers, who also fish, grow some millet and raise small pigs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beneficiaries of the loan are 20 members of the village women&apos;s group, who each received $70 in July 2005 and will reimburse their loans by the end of April, 2006. The group will use the funds for their small business, processing and marketing fish and other seafoods.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1400</funded_amount><paid_amount>1400</paid_amount><image><id>319</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Processing and marketing fish and other seafoods.</use><location><country_code>SN</country_code><country>Senegal</country><town>Carabane</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>12.533333 -16.716667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>4</partner_id><posted_date>2006-02-15T18:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1400</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Khadyjatou</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>1400</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1400</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>1400</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2006-12-07T21:58:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-12-07T21:58:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>2925</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2006-12-07T21:58:55Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>8</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>154</id><name>Foutoumata</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;em&gt;This is a group loan where a group of women will share the risk of the loan together. A representative, Fatoumata D., will deliver the repayment.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please note: The agreement with the Femmes de Nder group was that they would repay the entire Kiva loan at the end of the borrowing period (January 2007) rather than in installments.  This is because the group leader wishes to give each member the opportunity to borrow a small portion of the total loan amount for her own business activities, for a length of time that is less than the total nine-month term of the Kiva loan.  The individual will then repay the loan she has taken to the group fund, which will in turn lend it to another member.  Allowing the group to repay the entire loan at the end of the borrowing period in this way allows them to take turns borrowing, extending access to more members.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;« Femmes de Nder » is the women&apos;s group of the 300 person village of Nder in the north of Senegal near the Mauritanian border, also known as the ancient capital of the Walo, one of the Kingdoms of the Wolof ethnic group, conquered by the French. GENSEN has approved this group&apos;s request for credit and has received $100 in donations to open their account. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorporated in 1994 as a Groupement d&apos;Interet Economique or GIE, which is the smallest type of government recognized business, the group currently has 44 members. It first created, farmed and sold the produce from a communal field, using the profits to develop a small cash fund. By collecting dues of $0.20 per month from each member, the group began a rotating credit system, lending from $10 to $50 with 5% interest. They have continued this lending system, dropped the interest rate, and increased the membership dues to a dollar every 4 months. The total in the fund is about $1,200. The group has received and repaid a substantial loan from a federation of women&apos;s groups in their regional capital city of Saint Louis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group also owns large cooking utensils that it rents out to members of the village for parties and ceremonies, the profits of which go back into the fund. Either as a group or through small businesses of its members Femmes de Nder cultivates sweet potatoes, harvests and processes incenses that grows as bulbous roots of an indigenous grass, raises chickens, goats, and sheep; practices local crafts, engages in commerce between Mauritania and Senegal and operates small restaurants. Each year, the group also pays for 4 members to go on a religious pilgrimage to Tivaouane, the holy city of their Muslim religious brotherhood. </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>320</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>$50 for 20 people to develop saleable foods and crafts</use><location><country_code>SN</country_code><country>Senegal</country><town>Nder</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>16.255 -15.887222</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>4</partner_id><posted_date>2006-02-15T18:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Foutoumata</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>1000</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2006-08-15T15:07:23Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-08-15T15:07:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1000</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>824</payment_id><comment>The Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund (SEM) is pleased to announce The &apos;Femmes de Nder&apos; have repaid their loan in full 5 months after the loan after was distributed.

April 20, Rami made a payment of $50 toward his $500 loan, which was funded by generous Kiva lenders like you.

Bikes&#13;&#10;play an important role for transport for members of&#13;&#10;the Roma community&#13;&#10;for two key reasons: 1) very few Roma own functioning&#13;&#10;vehicles and 2)&#13;&#10;public transport does not serve the Nedeshda.  As&#13;&#10;such, the Roma&#13;&#10;without donkeys predominately get around by riding&#13;&#10;their bikes and&#13;&#10;walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The focus of Angel&apos;s business will be fixing punctured&#13;&#10;tires and&#13;&#10;tubes, broken chains and petals.

over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He is Acholi and is one of the many thousands of people who were forced to flee their homes in the North because of the war that has been going on for the last 20 years.  His family lives in an Internally Displaced People&apos;s camp in the outskirts of Kampala called the Acholi Quarter. Six months ago J. joined Life in Africa and has been an active member ever since.  He started as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project but his hard work and determination quickly earned him a promotion to a sanding processor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He has acquired a piece of land from the King of Buganda who has sympathy for the people of Acholi and who has set aside free land for them.  Knowing that the people of the Acholi quarter have to go long distances to look for water, he has a plan to install a water tap on his land. The current water sellers who bring water in to this hilltop area are charging five shillings per litre for water which makes it very hard for the people to purchase water for their needs.  With a water tap installed on his land, J. will be able to purchase water for only one shilling per litre and he plans on selling this water for a reduced rate of  3 shillings per litre to his community.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Not only will this provide a steady income for his family needs, but it will also offer a valuable service to his community at a more affordable price than they can currently get. This will insure that he has a secure source of buyers for his water, and it is likely to have a great impact on those living in the Acholi quarters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To accomplish this project, J. is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475).  He es-timates that once he acquires this loan it will take approximately one week to have the water tap installed.  Below is his budget:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;16 metal pipes @ 12000= each =192000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;connection fee to national water=300000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;labor charges &amp; other expenses =200000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;building of small house so that the tap can be locked to avoid theft =100000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The whole total is 792000=.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Based on his current income, J. will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. J. loves music and dance, and has designated the community impact portion of the interest he pays to support Life in Africa&apos;s Talent Discovery program.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>438</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Water Distribution</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Installation of water tap &amp;

In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Five years ago she was faced with the problem of earning enough money to support herself and her children.  As with many women in her situation, she turned to something she knew to try and earn money. She happened to know how to make good peanut butter and so she started her small business. Her main goal was to be self reliant and to serve her customers well while earning an income to support her children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the beginning she used the age old method of grinding the nuts using a mortar and pestle.  This method worked but it was a very slow process and she found she was not able to make the peanut butter fast enough to earn adequate money. To remedy this, she carefully planned and saved to purchase a processing machine. This enabled her to process enough to meet the de-mands of her customers and her business grew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But her good business sense tells her that she can do more.  She now has the capability of pro-ducing large quantities but still must produce smaller batches because she has no way of storing it until it is sold.  This will require the purchase of a refrigerator which will allow her to always have a supply on hand and will also enable her to increase her number of customers. To accomplish this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us. This amount will purchase a refrigerator, additional packing materials needed and the necessary capital to expand her production.  &#13;&#10;Below is her budget:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; 800,000/= LOAN BUDGET&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;FRIDGE 400,000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;PACKING MATERIALS 200,000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;ADDITIONAL CAPITAL 200,000=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;TOTAL 800,000=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Based on her current income, Grace will be able to repay the loan in 6 months. She has desig-nated 1/4 of the interest she pays on this loan to support educational opportunities for Life in Af-rica member children.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>439</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase of fridge, additional packing &amp; raw materials</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kampala</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.315556 32.565556</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2006-05-15T17:00:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Grace</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2005-04-14T05:27:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_amount>475</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>73</amount><local_amount>73</local_amount><processed_date>2006-05-09T13:27:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>73</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>288</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>79</amount><local_amount>79</local_amount><processed_date>2006-06-21T12:07:03Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>79</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>475</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>79</amount><local_amount>79</local_amount><processed_date>2006-07-17T15:17:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>79</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>573</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>79</amount><local_amount>79</local_amount><processed_date>2006-08-17T14:38:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>79</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>828</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>1925</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2005-03-31T06:27:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2006-10-23T12:24:35Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>5</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>278</id><name>Zarina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Zarina A. is a widow with three children. When her husband died unexpectedly she had just given birth to the third child and she was left with the sole responsibility of providing for herself and her children. This is no easy task for a woman in Uganda but Zarina was determined and remarkably managed to obtain a job as a housekeeper in Kampala. It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa and she has been an active member for the last five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Zarina saw value in building rental properties as a way to provide for her children&apos;s education. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa and built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now and she was able to responsibly pay back all her loans.  She earns an income from this property of shs. 200,000 ($111) each month. But the house is not yet plastered.

His hope is to eventually return to University for further studies, but in Peterâ€™s family itâ€™s become urgent that he starts to think about finding a wife â€“ two of his younger brothers have serious girlfriends they would like to marry, but it is against custom for them to marry before their older brothers do.  With his recent promotion, Peter also believes itâ€™s time he started to think seriously about his future, and a wife is definitely part of the plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In Uganda, however, marriage is not a day long event but a long process that begins at the point Peter finds himself now. Since itâ€™s taboo for any girl Peter brings home to enter his fatherâ€™s house, the first thing that must happen is that Peter builds a house of his own on his fatherâ€™s land in Tororo (Eastern Uganda). Peter has been saving for this purpose and would like a loan of shs. 800,000 ($475) to add to what he has saved and complete the house quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Peter is an extremely sincere, hardworking and capable young man, and very popular with the Life in Africa members - who are all now wondering who his choice of bride will be!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Below is Peterâ€™s budget: &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Cement 20 Bags @ 17000 = 52000 &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Sand 2 Trips @ 30000 = 60000 &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Doors 4 @ 50000 = 200000 &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Windows 4 @ 15000 = 60000&lt;br&gt; &#13;&#10;Nails 4kg @ 4000 = 16000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Based on his current income, Peter will be able to repay this loan in 8 months.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Since then she has been a very active member and has become a leader at the WE Center. She is a single mother raising three children and she always works very hard to provide for them and to keep them in school. As they get older, the school fees increase and she is looking for a way to insure that she will be able to pay all the fees so they can complete their education. She does not think that being a single mother should be a barrier to her children&apos;s education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Even with all the demands for their needs, she has managed to save enough money to acquire a plot of land. She plans to build a house on this land that she will rent out. The income from this rental property will be specifically used for her children&apos;s education. Housing is in high demand so this will be a sound investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475) to assist her in starting the first phase of her project. She has savings that she will add to this loan to purchase the necessary materials to lay the foundation and build part of the walls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her total project budget is shs. 3,252,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the 800,000/= that Teopista is asking to borrow for the first phase, she plans to buy:&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bricks   7,000 @  60/=          420,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Cement   20 bags @ 18,000/=     360,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Transport                        20,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;TOTAL                           780,000/=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Based on her current income, Teopista will be able to repay the loan in 12 months. She has des-ignated 25% of the interest she pays on the loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Internet4Change training program.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>443</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Land

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is a widowed mother of three beautiful children. She joined Life in Africa in 2003 and is now the WE Center Manager. She is loved and respected by all who work with her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;5 years ago, Monica&apos;s husband died of injuries he suffered in a trucking accident. After he died, his family came and claimed all his property, including their family home, leaving Monica and her children left on the street to start life over from scratch. This sort of thing happens far too often in Uganda and there was nothing legal that Monica could do. When she found her way to Life in Af-rica she was destitute, but realized that she could learn new skills that might improve her situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monica learned quickly and worked hard. She is now the Manager of the Life in Africa WE Center and earns a steady income. Her children are all in school and their lives have greatly improved. But they still have no home to call their own, and this is a painful memory for the whole family. Monica feels it&apos;s important to give her children a home that no one can take away from them or evict them from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has sold some property her family owned in her village and has managed to buy a plot of land in Kireka on the outskirts of Kampala. Here she plans to build a solid family home. She has carefully planned and the project will be completed in three years using money she saves from her salary and a series of loans. The total budget for the house she wishes to build is shs. 13,000,000 ($7220).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is seeking a loan in the amount of shs 800,000 ($475) for the first phase. This will build the foundation of the house. Once this loan is repaid, she will start on the next phase and continue until the house is built. The loan she is requesting will enable her to buy: hard core stones, bricks, sand, and cement, all for laying the foundation of the house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Based on her current income, Monica can repay this loan in 12 months. She has designated 1/4 of the interest she pays on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Internet4Change training program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>444</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She has been straggling with irrigation using local means on a small piece of land but it would have been better if she had a water pump. &#13;&#10;This is costly and thus would like to buy a dairy cow for zero grazing.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>461</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>She

She has been an acitve&#13;&#10;member of Life in Africa since March of 2005. She&#13;&#10;works as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children &#13;&#10;Bracelet Project which now provides her with a steady&#13;&#10;income. She also runs a stall at a local market in&#13;&#10;Kampala from which she also receives some money.&#13;&#10;Together these two jobs allow her to maintain her&#13;&#10;large family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rebecca is very passionate about educating her&#13;&#10;children. She says, &quot;They should have the education I&#13;&#10;never had.&quot; But school fees for eight children is very&#13;&#10;challenging. She is looking for ways to add to her &#13;&#10;income to insure that this challenge can be met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rebecca&apos;s church owns some land with clay on it that&#13;&#10;it makes available to church members for making&#13;&#10;bricks. Rebecca has already seen one of her daughters&#13;&#10;do quite well in this business. She is thus seeking a&#13;&#10;loan in the amount of shs. 500,000 ($280) to fund the&#13;&#10;start-up of her own brick business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This investment will create 2 jobs for others who will&#13;&#10;make the bricks, and she plans on using this business &#13;&#10;to finance the building of some tenant houses on her&#13;&#10;property. These she will rent out to further add to&#13;&#10;her income so that the necessary school fees for her&#13;&#10;children will be paid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Below is her budget. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Firewood -- 25,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Transport -- 10,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Labour -- 435,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Total -- 500,000/=&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;According to Rebecca&apos;s current income, she hopes to be&#13;&#10;able to repay this loan in 10 months.

She is also planning to increase her crops through renting one more hectare of land, which is worth $200 yearly. P. will have to purchase more seeds, for $1.25 per 10 square meters, and she knows she will have to work harder with her husband but they expect to increase their annual income over the next few years.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;P. is not satisfied with this business: they can barely earn their living with it, she said. Her plan is to spare enough money to open a stand in the market, and sell her neighbors production.

She will also purchase her own stock of yellow wood, $50 per piece, and other materials required in her activity. This will allow her to substantially increase the income of her family, as these music instruments are usually sold $200 in Phnom Penh markets. We want to expand this business, S. said, because we love doing it.

Ken Samuon is not very confident about her future but her desire is to support her son to succeed in life.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;With the $1000 she requested from CREDIT, Samuon wants to allow her elder son to open a motorbike workshop in Phnom Penh City. She is borrowing for buying the tools, materials and spare parts required for such a business. The family as already found a place for rent for about $60 monthly and the owner has accepted to let them use the premises for free for a one month test period. Khen Samuon and her husband are willing to pay the first monthly installments with their own salaries but they are eventually expecting a daily income of 20,000 Riels, about $5, from the workshop, which will be enough to cover the interest and the reimbursement of the loan and generate a substantial income.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>473</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Vehicle

She is currently working in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project. She is educated and holds a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in Development studies but, since finishing her University studies, she has been unable to find a job. She supported herself by doing odd jobs and managed to earn enough money to open a small retail shop.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This shop is in a very good location and is lucrative because there are few other shops in the village. The people would have to walk very long distances to find the products she plans on offering. By bringing these products closer to them she will be guaranteed a large and solid customer base. This will not only provide more income for her but will also serve her community. For this reason she wishes to grow and expand her shop.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to purchase the stock needed to expand her existing shop.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below is her budget:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Sugar 2 bags @70,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rice 1 bag @70,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Batteries 2 boxes @ 5,500/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cooking oil 1 jerry can @ 20,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; fridge 1 Unit @ 300,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Soap 2 boxes @ 10,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Maize flour 1 bag @ 12,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Salt 2 cartons @ 10,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Paraffin 1 jerry can @ 26,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Match boxes 1 carton @ 7,500/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Baking Powder 1 box @ 48,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Geisha 1 box @ 8,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Millet flour 1 Bag @10,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; contingencies 32,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;              &lt;br /&gt; Total------------------ 800,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She will be paying 102,890/= per month for 10 months in order to completely service the loan properly.

He lives with his wife and three children in the IDP camp known as the Acholi quarter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He, like thousands of other Acholis, was forced to flee their homes due to the war in the north. Initially at the camp, he earned what little he could at the stone quarry but he found this inadequate since he could not provide enough food, medicine or schooling for his children. Working at LiA has greatly improved his life and now he is able to provide these basics for his family. But he is a business man at heart. He owned a shop in the north and was forced to leave it but his mind still thinks in terms of business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He has been able to negotiate a busness deal with a local secondary school to provide them with flour each term (three times per year). He will travel to the rural area to buy the flour and then return with it to the school. He will be able to make a profit of 200,000 each term. He will continue with his work at LiA since this business will only require his attention 3 times per year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He is seeking a loan in the amount of 700,000 to make the initial puchase of flour. He will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below is his budget:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 15 bags of maize flour @ 30000/ = 450000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Transport 200000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Misllenoius 50000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Total 700000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The nature of his busines gives him time to proceed with his job because he has go and buy once then supplies to school direct. This means he can do it himself just those 3 times and no need for rent. According to his current income, he will be able to pay the loan in 12 installments, and will almost double the loan amount during that period. Okidi has designated the community impact portion of the interest he pays to support the Life in Africa Talent Discovery team.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>478</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Joyce M. is a Patchwork and Embroidery designer specializing in wall hangings of flowers, animals, birds, and persons. She joined Life in Africa 2 years ago and she has since then been a very active member of the WE Center. She has passed on her skills to some of the members of the Center and she is actually the best person one would ever want to work with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has developed a good reputation with many International families living in Kampala and they have become customers. She has a stall near her home where she hangs and displays her work but she also does many hangings by special order for her customers. She is now in a good position to expand her business since the demand for her products is now more than what she can produce herself.. And in doing this she will be able to offer jobs to one or two other LiA members to assist her in the production process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To fund this expansion Joyce is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us. This will purchase enough materials to complete 100 wall hangings. These will be sold from her stall, at bazaars and at exhibitions as well as to her current client base. With the addition of some hired help, she will be able to complete the 100 hangings in four months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is her budget of what she needs to buy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Item/ Quantity/ Cost/ Total&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poly Viscose.

She has designated the community impact portion of the interest she pays to support Life in Africa&apos;s Internet4Change Team, who need more computers so they can better help Joyce to sell some of her patchworks online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about Joyce at &lt;a href=&quot;http://joyceM..blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://joyceM..blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

This could not earn him enough money so, he decided to join the rest at the stone quarry, a job he did until the news of the bracket project by life in Africa knocked on his door.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This gave him a lot of uplift in his earning that during the few months of working with them, he managed to acquire a small plot that he now wished to develop into a family house.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He therefore seeks a loan of 500,000/= which he will pay back in 12 mouths at 50,415 @&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Budget&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bricks 1500 x 60/= - 90,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cement 5bags x 18,000/= - 90,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Iron sheets 15 x 10,000/= = 150,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Roofing poles 10 x 3000/= - 30,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Sand 1 trip x 6,000/= - 60,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Doors and window frames – 40,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Transport – 30,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Contingency – 10,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total ----------- 500,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since he already has building skills, Robert will be doing his work himself so no labour cost. After this Robert plans to get a bigger land where he will build rental houses that will enable his children go to school. Robert has designated the community impact portion of the interest he will pay on this loan to support educational opportunities for LiA member children.&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>482</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

They came to Kampala when the war intensified in Northern Uganda and every body was being forced to move into the IDP Camps. She knew how hard life would be in the camps and she thought she could make a better life in the capital city of Kampala. She is a hard worker and believes in doing whatever it takes to provide for her children. She works at many things including housekeeping and running small businesses. She has had her best success in selling charcoal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She now works in Invisible Children Bracelet Project at Life in Africa. Her sister, who also was forced to flee because of the war, lives with her and runs the charcoal business. Their lives have much improved but she realizes that the charcoal business can be much more profitable if you have the capital to stock more. For this reason, she wishes to expand her business by seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With the additonal profits from the business, her salary at LiA,and the money she has already saved she plans to buy a piece of land. Here she will build a house for her family to live in and another house to rent out which will increase their income and allow them to live a better and more secure life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below is her budget in full:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Charcoal – 40 bags x 8,000/= -----320,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Transport ----------- 160,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Loading -------------- 20,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Total ------------- 500,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. She has designated the community impact portion of the interest she will pay on the loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Adult Education Program, where she is excited to now be learning

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He is a resident of Acholi quarters (a displaced people&apos;s camp in the surburb of Kampala). At the camp, his only source of income was the stone quarry where he worked very hard to make barely enough money to exist on. Since coming to Life in Africa, his life has totally changed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He moved to Kampala as a result of the war in Northern Uganda. There he also was forced to live in an IDP camp and conditions were very hard. He had to leave school when he couldn&apos;t raise money for his school fees and his family had a hard time even getting enough food. He now lives with his brother and part of the money he earns he sends to his family back in Gulu to pay for school fees for his younger brothers and to help the family buy food.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; His plan now is to start up a used clothing business. His brother has agreed to run the business while Stephen continues his work at Life in Africa. He plans to use the additional income from this business to start saving for building a family house that will enable him to bring down his family who are still suffering in the camps in northen Uganda.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For this business, he is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below are his full budget:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; 1- 2 bales of clothes @ 150,000/= ------ 300,000/=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2- Transport ---------- 40,000/=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3- Rent for space @ 30,000/=@month ----- 90,000/=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4- licence --------- 50,000/=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5- contingencies ---------- 20,000/=&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;     &lt;br /&gt; TOTAL ------------ 500,000/=&lt;br /&gt; With the income he now earns through the WE Center Kampala, Stephen will be able to repay the loan in 12 months. He has designated 25% of the interest he pays to support the new Life in Africa WE Center in Gulu.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>492</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He currently works at the WE Center as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He is Acholi and his home used to be Gulu in Northern Uganda. However, in 1997 the war there became so dangerous that he was forced to flee and come to Kampala where he lives in the displaced persons camp known as the Acholi quarters. There, he and his wife worked in the quarry and barely earned enough to feed their five children much less provide such things as school fees. He now works at LiA while his wife continues at the quarry. Their combined income can now provide a much better life for the family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But living conditions are not good in the camp and he dreams of having a home of their own. He has acquired a piece of land donated by the King of Buganda and it is his intent to build a modest two room home on it so that his children will not have to live in a rented house. To do this he is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below is his break down.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He wants to buy the following materials&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; 1: 12 iron sheets @----------------11000--------132,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2: 12 bags of cement @--------------18500-----201,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3: 3000 bricks @ 60-----------------------------180,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4:13 pieces of timber for roofing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (3x4)- 3000----24,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (4x2)-----5000-------------------20,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5: 2 trips of sand @----------60000----------------120,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6: transporting materials to the site-------------- 40,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 7: Labour-------------------------------------------83,000/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;         &lt;br /&gt; TOTAL: 800,000/&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; According to his current income, he will be able to repay this loan in 12months and he will be paying 80,665 per month. O. has designated the community impact portion of the interest he will pay to support the Transport for Life in Africa team, which is currently trying to raise money for a LiA community owned vehicle that can help transport workers to the WE Center.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>484</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal Housing

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is the sole breadwinner for seven children. She is very talented in the art of handicrafts and earns her living by making and selling beautiful basket, bracelets, shopping bags and many other items.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She faces several challenges in her work. The first is that she is an asthmatic. This makes it very difficult to work during the cold and wet season. However, she does not let this fact stop her and she works hard even when she is sick. These skills, her determination and her good business sense allow her to provide the basic needs for her family. Her other challenge is providing the school fees to educate all her children. Their education has become her number one priority.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To overcome this last challenge, Edidah has devised a plan to constuct a two room house that she will rent out. She owns a plot of land located at Mutungo near Kampala and she has family there to help in the constuction of this house. This project will take about three months to complete and once it is finished, she will use the income from this property to pay the school fees that will insure the education of her children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 500,000.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Below is her budget:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cement - 12 bags 200,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Doors - 2 pcs 90,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Wood - 20 pcs 100,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Labour - 85,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bricks ((3500in number) 24,500/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;     &lt;br /&gt; Total 500,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Loan Amount 500,000/=&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Edidah will be able to repay her loan in 10 installments. She has designated 25% of the interest she pays on the loan to support the WE Team for developing self-sustaining project at LiA, which she currently leads.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>485</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Purchase

Ecuador for more than 30 years. She has owned this store for 23 years with the help of her husband and only son. Her husband is in charge of buying merchandise for the store, but he can only buy as much as the store sells in the short term.

was born in Guayaquil, is a 49-year-old bicycle salesman who has been in business for 3 years. His small enterprise is located in the house that he and his brothers inherited from his father. His bike shop is strategically located because there is not another similar business like this nearby. Working from 9 am until 7 pm, Pedro desperately needs this capital to serve his clients better. He would like lenders to know that he is running a professional bike shop and that he is very responsible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Justificacion de Credito- &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pedro M.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nació en Guayaquil, tiene 49 años de edad, es soltero, &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;posee un negocio de venta de repuestos y arreglos de&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;bicicletas desde hace 3 años, el negocio esta ubicado en su domicilio que fue herencia de sus padres con otros hermanos, &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;la ubicación es estratégica porque no hay ese tipo de negocio en la zona y esta muy bien ubicado, atiende de 9:00AM hasta las 7:00PM., el esta solicitando el crédito para comprar más repuestos y surtir su negocio y atender mejor a sus clientes.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He has done this business before. He has tried it out with rudimentary methods, which has limited him to certain customers. The clients with heavy woolen clothings like blankets, coats, bedcovers,etc which require the use of a washing machine. What he needs now is to improve on the standard of his work and also be able to cater for all these customers. He needs to buy the necessary equipments and this is the reason why he is requesting for a loan. The number of people who require his services have also increased. This is because his only competitors got their houses demolished after their landlord selling off the land where they were operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ismeal lives in Bukoto, this is the next place to Ntinda where Life in Africa is situated. He has a wife and two children living with him. He joined life in Africa in october 2005, as a trainee internet4change Uganda. He got ajob with invisible children as a bracelet maker in Febuary 2006. Before he was doing this work but since he got another job as mentioned above, his cousin will help him do the laundry work. He has already saved 100,000/= for detergents and some few things he may need to add. He will also pay his cousin 30,000/= per month for helping him. He is requesting a loan of 700,000/= payable in 12 months. He will be paying 70,000/= per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is his budget:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Washing Machine 500,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counter Board 80,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ironing Board 30,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flat iron 30,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polythen Covers/coat covers (12) 6,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metallic Hangers (12) 5,000/= &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation of machine and Labour 50,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total 701,000/=&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ismael&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by his community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala. He has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest he pays on this loan to support LiA&apos;s Internet4Change Team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November.

It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Grace is an active member of Life in Africa working as a bracelet maker in the invisible children bracelet project. She lives with her husband and child in the IDP camp know as the Acholi quarters. Her husband works as a carpenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They, like so many other families, had to flee their home in Gulu because of the war. They find life in the camp difficult. They are able to earn enough for the basic needs but they know that they would be much better off if they could eliminate the rent which is one of the biggest expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have acquired a plot of land from the king of Buganda who donated free land to the Acholi. Here A. and her husband plan to build a two roomed house and, once it is done, this will free up a good part of their income to be used for other purposes such as food and helping their relatives. The husband is a carpenter and is able to mobilize his colleagues to help in the construction thereby saving the labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this project she is seeking a loan in the amount of 700,000/= that she will repay in 12 months at a rate of 58,333/= per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her break down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-99 poles both for the wall and the roof @ 2000 each = 198,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-18 iron sheets ‘gauge 23’ @ 10,000/ = 180,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-4 bags of cement @ 72,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-water to be used in the construction =30,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-transport =30,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-sand 1 trip= 50,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-2 wooden doors @ 50,000 =100000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;docutils option-list&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;option-group&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;option&quot;&gt;-2 wooden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;windows @ 20,000/= 40,000/=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total=700,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He has proved himself to be a very hard worker as a sander and bracelet maker for the Invisible Children Bracelet project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred is a father of four children. It is very expensive raising children and providing them with school fees, food, medical care and housing. He manages but knows that there are ways he could improve their standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his father died, Fred inherited three, two room houses in Makindye which is a suburb of Kampala. His family currently lives in one of the houses and he rents out the other two. But the houses are only partly finished and so he can only charge a small rent. If the houses were properly finished, he could rent them for more money and this extra money would enable his family to live an easier life. It would also provide better housing for his tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the reasons above, he requests a loan in the amount of 700,000/=. He will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. He will be paying 70,000/= per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will use the loan as below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cement 10 bags each bag at 19,000/=............................190,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sand 2 trips each at80,000/=...................................160,000/= &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doors 3 each at 60,000/=...................................... 180,000/= &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 3 each at 40,000/=.....................................120,000/= &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour..........................................................50,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total..........................................................700,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by his community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala. He has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest he will pay on this loan to support the Community Guaranteed Lending Team at Life in Africa.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Her parents died when she was only 8 leaving her and her two brothers alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were taken in by an aunt but life was very hard. The aunt, who was a widow herself, was taking care of many children and the grandmother who is blind. With very little money, food was often scarce and the only schooling Monica could afford was a tailor course. She did manage to get a job but could not earn enough money to exist on. Then she came to LiA. She now earns enough to help with food, rent, school fees for her brothers and support for her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With encouragement from her determined aunt, she is learning to be independent and to forget that she is an orphan. She has managed to save enough to set up a small shop. Her cousin runs the shop during the day while Monica works. Now she would like to do more. If she adds more stock to the shop, her profits will increase. She also plans to use her tailoring skills by purchasing a sewing machine. Since her shop has a big veranda, she will put this sewing machine there and use on the weekends to earn money. For this project she is seeking a loan of 800,000/=. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months at a rate of 66,667/= per month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is her budget:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;arabic simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sewing machine @ …………. 250, 000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;adding stock:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;100kgs of rice @ 900/= ………………90,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50kgs of sugar ……………………70,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20 liters of cooking oil…………….40, 000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;100kgs of maize flour @ 600/=……60,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;60kgs of beans @ 1,000/=………….60,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50kgs of groundnuts @ 2,000/=…….100,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50kgs of Simsim @ 1,500/=  …………75,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 box of washing soap ………………...25,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transport ………………………………30,000/=&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The total is 800,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monica&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Internet4Change team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She joined through the Acholi Quarter Satelite Center. She moved to Kampala from the Gulu in the North to escape the war but she does not live in the quarters. However, she went there each day to work in the rock quarry. This was very hard on her since she had no money for transport and this forced her to walk 3 kms each way. She earned barely enough money to survive on but she had no choice since the survival of her family depended on what she could earn. Many days they had no food and they lived under the constant threat from the landlord of being thrown out of their home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace&apos;s move to Kampala also has another reason. While still in the North, Grace and her husband had divorced and she was left with her eight children to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life in Africa has given Grace and her family new hope. The association with others and the sharing of knowledge and skills has given Grace the idea and desire to start a business. School fees for eight children is almost impossible and she worries, especially about the older girls. Her plan is to open a maize flour shop near her home. She has a 25 year old daughter who will work the shop. I talked to the daughter is she is very excited. It will not only give her work to do but she is happy that she will be earning money to help her mother and perhaps help pay school fees for her siblings. For this project Grace is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is her budget in full:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1- Maize 10 bags  @  50,000/=  --------------------- 500,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2- Grinding 10 bags @  6,000/= ---------           60,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3 - Rent  for 3 months  @ 50,000/=  ---------     150,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4- Transport   ---------------------------------------   90,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TOTAL        --------------------------------    800,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace plans that with all she will save, she can send all her children back to school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Educational opportunities for LiA member children.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Irene is an active member of Life in Africa working in the invisible Bracelet project as a bracelet maker. Before coming to LIA, she earned her living working in the stone quarry near the Acholi quarters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was forced to flee Northern Uganda because of the war and, as most displaced Acholi, she settled in the displaced persons camp. Life there is very hard and basic needs are hard to come by. One such need is water. There are few tap water supplies and this makes it very expensive for the people to get water and they have to walk very far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her plan is to install a water tap in the part of the quarter where she lives. She will be able to provide the water at a less expensive rate and it will also benefit the community by shortening the distance they have to travel to get water. There has recently been another installation of a successful water tap but the quarters are very large and one tap will not fill the needs of so many people. This will give her a strong customer base and make it a profitable business venture. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000/=. She will be able to repay the loan in 12 months at a rate of 66,667/= per month. Once cash is at hand, the whole processes to have tap water is only one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is her break down:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;35 pieces of metallic pipes @ 10,000         =350,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labor charges ………………………         300,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Construction of shelter against wastages….100,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charges from national water authority ……30,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transport……………………………………10,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other ……………………………………….10,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The total amount is 800,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Irene&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s talent discovery team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Mary is an active member of Life in Africa. She works as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project. Here she earns enough to support herself and her children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is Acholi and was born in Northern Uganda. Eight years ago she was forced to flee the brutal war in the north and since then she has been living in the camp known as the Acholi quarters in Kampala. Here she lives in a small rented house. However, she has acquired a plot of land which was donated by the King of Buganda because of his sympathies for the Acholi. She now wishes to apply for a loan in order to build a two roomed house for her family. Growing up during 20 years of war and living eight years in a camp have made having a permanent safe home a priority. For this she is asking for 600,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poles for the wall 120 @ 2000/ = 240000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iron sheets 12 @ 10000 = 120000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roofing timbers 15 @ 5000 = 75000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nails 10kgs @ 2000 = 20000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labor = 120000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total = 575000shs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Talent Discovery team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Adrine is an active member of life in Africa. She is a single mother of two children. She was deserted by her husband and left to make a life the best she could. Being poor and a single mother is very difficult but she works hard in spite of the challenges to provide for her children and give them the education she never had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She works for Invisible Children Crew as a bracelet maker. This helps her provide for the basics at home and even pay school fees for her children. Her son will be joining Kyambogo University this coming year. The greatest challenge she has, is having no house in the village. She had to leave her children in the village with her family while she came to Kampala to earn money. When she goes to the village to visit them, she has to share a room with her brothers. It is not easy to get one family to share their home with another family when they are already crowded. In Kampala she is only able to rent one small room for herself and she dreams of the day when she will be reunited with her children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her plan is to build a house in the village where her children will live comfortably and where she will stay on her visits. Her son and her brother will supervise the construction for her. She owns two cows which she plans to sell. They are worth 900,000/=. In addition to this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000/= to complete the project. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. Her payment will be 50,000/= per month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is her budget:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bricks 3000 @ shs. 60...........................................180,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cement 15 bags @ shs. 18,000................................... 270,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sand 2 trips @ shs. 60,000..................................... 120,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Timber, nails and iron sheets.................................. 303,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutters....................................................... 200,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transport....................................................... 70,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labour..........................................................200,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total.........................................................1,343,000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adrine&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s craft product development team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is employed as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She has three children and she lives in the Acholi quarter which is a camp for displaced persons from the north. &lt;p&gt;She and her family were forced to flee their home in the north because of the war. They settled in the camp as did most Acholis who fled to Kampala and she earned what little money she could by selling bananas. She would tie her baby on her back, carry a basket of bananas on her head, and she would walk all day trying to sell enough to make ends meet. She barely earned enough to pay the rent and feed them so school was just not possible. Since coming to LiA, their lives have greatly improved. Now she has no problem paying the rent, her children are not hungry and they even go to school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The King of Buganda has great sympathy for the Acholi and has donated land to them. She has acquired a plot of this land and she now wishes to build a two roomed house for her family that will be permanent and safe. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 600,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;below is her break down:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3000 bricks @ 45shs = 135000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;10 bags of cement @ 18000shs = 180000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;15 pieces of iron sheets @ 10000shs 150000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;16 pieces of poles @ 1000shs = 16000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labour =100000/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nails 5 kgs @ 150 = 7500/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total = 588500/=&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evalyn&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala. She has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest on her loan to support Life in Africa&apos;s Talent Discovery team.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;. You can also see an interview with Grace about the challenges of leading the LiA community at &lt;a

have made on our member&apos;s life, and on our &#13;&#10;community&apos;s ability to learn how to enable and manage access to micro-loans for our members. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Sincerely&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Christina Jordan&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Founder &amp; Managing Director&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Life in Africa - WE

local technical college in Sliven, Bulgaria, with the U.S.-equivalent of an associate&apos;s degree in electrical repair in the mid-1980s.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He began work at a large, state-run electrical repair shop until the fall of communism in 1989.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Like many Bulgarians, he soon found himself out of work.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In early 1991, he struck out on his own and started his own electrical repair shop.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He sells spare parts and fixes a broad range of electrical devices, usually TVs, VCRs, and radios, although he sees the occasional kitchen appliance.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Toncho also sells a small selection of new and used appliances, and this loan will help him expand that part of the business.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The loan proceeds will be used to expand his shop to include a separate showroom and increase his inventory.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Chinese industrial revolution has had a dramatic impact on the sales of low-end electrical appliances in Bulgaria, as their costs have dropped to the point where an increasing number of Bulgarians can afford them.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;While DVD players remain rare (a $100 player is 2 weeks salary for most here) many families are using small credit programs to finally replace 20-year old appliances.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We think Toncho is well-positioned to address this growing market in Sliven.&lt;span&gt;

a café in the Turkish quarter of Sliven, Bulgaria.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is a modest spot, predominately offering drinks and simple foods, such as crepes, and a well-worn pool table.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The café seats up to 12 people.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;In conjunction with the café, Bahar’s wife runs a business importing textiles from Turkey.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;She makes the trip to Turkey monthly, bringing back predominately clothes, which she then sells in a corner of the café and a variety of local markets.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;She typically makes the trip to Turkey on the night train with two of her three grown children for safety’s sake.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

fund two things: 1) working capital for the café and 2) inventory and transportation expenses for the clothing business.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

after the brutal Ottoman occupation of Bulgaria (15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century) the Turks who remained in Bulgaria for the most part either cloistered themselves or moved east to be again inside Ottoman lands.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;10% of the Bulgarian population is of Turkish descent, and is often excluded from mainstream society due to their religion (Islam) and residual resentment many ethnic Bulgarians still feel against the Turks, nearly 150 years later.&lt;span&gt;

small grocery in one of the Roma neighborhoods in Sliven, Bulgaria.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;She has had this small store for 15 years, and has built up enough of a capital base to enable her to extend credit to many of her customers in difficult times.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, she has found herself with a surprising expense – a new refrigerator. Her current cooler has started to leak badly, and has become prohibitively expensive to operate, increasingly so as the summer approaches.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Unplugging it is not an option – yogurt is a staple of the Bulgarian diet, accounting for a significant amount of her sales year-round, and in the summer, ice cream sales become a major revenue contributor.&lt;span&gt;

Clarinet, Trumpet, etc. – as the situation requires, in addition to the piano and accordion.&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:

for 28 years.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Once he reached the mandatory retirement age, Alexander joined the Karandila Orchestra, a Roma group based in Sliven, Bulgaria, which plays weddings and tours as often as they can.  One of the most unfortunate aspects of the transition from communism to capitalism is the lack of savings of the eldery, coupled with the low support from the state.  For those currently in the 65-85 age bracket, their entire working years was during communism.  During that time there was little money to be saved, but there was little perceived need; the government would take care of them.  As that paradigm has shifted dramatically, many of those who have &quot;retired&quot; have returned to the workforce to supplement the $50 the government gives them monthly.  &lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This loan will be used to finance the upfront costs for this summer’s work; travel expenses, instrument tuning and the purchase of this year’s uniform.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The loan duration is 1 year, although we expect the preponderance of the loan to be repaid in a shorter time frame.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Lenders interested in learning more about the Roma culture in Bulgaria might find “Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey” by Isabel Fonseca to be helpful.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The book was published in 1995 and is widely available.&lt;span&gt;

I have used three small loans from this group, the first one was USD.60, then,USD 165 and USD 225. I paid all these loans promptly and i hope to get another to push me forward.

Mr. P. is a homeowner. His business is located in a section of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil&quot;&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; called Bastión Popular, and it has been in operation for seven years. His wife helps him with sales and administrative work from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;6:00 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; until 6:00 pm. Edgar is in charge of managing some customers’ weekly credit tabs, although most customers pay cash for his goods on the spot. He needs this loan money to be able to buy other products like watches, lamps, bed sheets, and other home items. Mr. P. thinks this loan will also help financially because he can receive a discount from wholesalers if he buys in bulk and pays in cash. Lastly, Edgar wants lenders to know that he is a hard-working entrepreneur. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His restaurant is located on one of Guayaqil’s major avenues and has been serving up Don P.’s famous recipe soup for 8 years. Before starting his own business, Cesar worked at a restaurant for 12 years. When he thought he was ready to open his own business, he used what little savings he had and rented a small storefront along a well-positioned thoroughfare in downtown Guayquil. He and his wife work hard every day from 6:00 am until &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1:00 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and they are requesting $1035.00 to be able to buy key ingredients in bulk. For instance: oil, dressing, cola, etc… He also would like to buy some uniform utensils and dishes to serve up encebollado.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Albert W. is a dedicated and talented young artist who joined Life in Africa in 2005. He was very excited to join since LiA offered him the opportunity to develop and use his artistic talent as well as to earn an income. He proved to be a fast learner and very quickly earned a job with the Invisible Children Bracelet project where he works as a sander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This income is very important to him. He is just a young man but when his father died he was the oldest and it was up to him to take over the responsiblity for his mother and younger siblings. He tried at first to do this by selling his artwork. He quickly found that selling art is not like selling food or charcoal which are needed on a daily basis. Art is more of a luxury and this made their life very difficult. But he is determined to do right for his family and he came up with a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His plan is to cash in on the high demand for decent housing by building three rooms to rent out. He and his brothers have worked very hard and have made 7000 bricks by hand that are now ready to be fired. He knows that once this project is complete the income will greatly improve their lives and will insure that there is sufficent money for school fees and medicine for his younger siblings. He is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 which will fire the bricks and build the house up to the beams. He will be able to repay this loan in 10 ,months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His budget is as indicated below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burning Bricks --------- Ushs.150,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cement 10 bags --------- Ushs.190,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sand 2 trips --------- Ushs.160,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concrete stones -------- Ushs.100,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tranport --------- Ushs. 60,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water --------- Ushs.20,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Labour --------- Ushs.100,000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentals --------- Ushs. 20,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total --------- Uhs.800,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to repay this loan in 10 months and his expenses verses income is 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE Team to Benefit:

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is a very happy and dedicated member who loves what is happening at LiA and all the opportunities that are made available to people just like her. She is currently working in the Invisible Children Bracelet project creating bracelets and this has greatly improved the lives of her family by providing a steady source of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has a large family and this means that the needs are also large. Her younger brother lives with her and together they have come up with a good plan to increase their income. Their plan is to purchase a motorcycle which her brother will operate as a a bodaboda (for hire). Transport is very needed in Kampala and bodaboda drivers can do quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money earned from this business will help the family but Joyce also realizes that as a young man, her brother also needs to have some money of his own. They have agreed that one day a week he will keep the money as his salary which will allow him to start saving for the time when he will have his own home and life. The family has already saved 500,000 towards this project. She is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to add to this to make the purchase. She will be able to repay this loan in 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wants to pay this loan in a period of 8 months and her income verses expenses is Ushs.190,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She saves Ushs. 50,000 per month and remains with Ushs. 140,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE Team to Benefit:

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Rebecca is a young woman full of hope for the future. She is an active member of Life in Africa and is employed in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. In addition she also participates in many of the other activities offered by LiA and her positive attitude affects all those she comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also is very responsible and has a good and generous heart. She supports her brother financially as well as two Aids orphans. These children are currently staying with relatives and even with the money she sends, they live under very poor conditions. She really wants to be able to give them a better life and longs to earn enough to provide school fees so these children can be educated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has a sister living in Kampala who is not able to go to school herself. Together they plan to open a second hand clothes business. Rebecca has worked in this type of business before and knows that she can make a good income once she gets it going. Her sister will help by working this business while Rebecca continues on at LiA. The business will be located at Kisasi trading center but they also plan to ocassionally shift to other locations to increase their business. She is so determined in this plan that she has already saved 150,000 towards the start up. She is seeking a loan in the amount 500,000 to add to this. She will be able to repay this loan in 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rent 4 months 200,000/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Shocks @ 150,000/

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Kyaziike Joan is a remarkable young woman. She is very responsible and dedicated even for her young years. She joined Life in Africa in November of 2005 and has been an active member being employed by the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She has just finished her secondary schooling and she now longs to go on to the University to complete her education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lives at home with her parents and she is the eldest of their four children. Her father&apos;s income in somewhat unsteady so she gladly helps financially using her salary. Her father wisely worked hard and built a two room house next to their family home. This is rented out and the income from this rental has paid the school fees for Joan so far. However, the University fees are much higher and they are looking at ways to increase their income to provide for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is to add two more rooms to the existing house. This will double the amount of rent they will earn. Housing is in great demand in Kampala so they know they will have no problem finding tenants. The money from this rental will be used to pay the University fees for Joan&apos;s education and for her younger siblings who will follow her. She has carefully saved as much of her salary as she could and has 400,000 to put into this project. She is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to complete it. She will be able to repay this loan in 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: 16 Iron sheets @------11000------------176,000/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2: 16 bags of cement

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She started as a volunteer working in the arts and crafts center and then moved to a paying job working with the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She enjoys working on this project and at LiA because it offers the workers a way out of poverty. She is a single woman living on her own without the help of her family and her salary sustains her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been fortunate to be able to live with friends who agreed to help her. Out of kindness toward her they have not charged her any rent. But she knows that this cannot continue since their own situation is very unstable. While she is very grateful for their kindness, she is now looking for a way to provide housing for herself as well as to add to her income. She has realized that housing is in great demand all the time in Kampala and she has decided to invest in property for herself and to rent out for income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase of this project will be to secure a plot of land. She has found the plot she wants and she has successfully negotiated a deal with the landowner. If she can come up with the money needed by the end of June he will sell her the property. Once she has paid for the land, she will then build a house on it to live in and also apartments that she will rent out. In this way she will be able to secure her future. To succeed at this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to add to the 2,200,000 that she has managed to save herself. She will be able to repay this loan in 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is her budget: Land Aqcuisition --- 800,000/= Total 800,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE Team to benefit: integrated Adult Education

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Rose is an active member of Life in Africa working in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She is 34 years old, is married and has 6 children. She is Acholi and originally lived in the Pader District in Northern Uganda. It was there that the rebels attacked her village and abducted two of her children. Her children were gone for two years but were finally rescued by government troups and were returned to her in the camp she fled to in Kampala. Rose and her husband both started working in the stone quarry but they were not able to earn enough to sustain the family. When she joined LiA their lives took a turn for the better. They have more money and they have been able to save enough to build a modest home which also helps financially since they no longer have to pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their plan now is to enlarge the stone quarry work that her husband still does. By making it their own business they will be able to hire others so her husband does not have to do all the work himself and their production will increase giving them more income. To do this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is young, dedicated and very determined to make a secure future for herself. She originally came from Western Uganda but moved to Kampala where she lives with an aunt who agreed to help her with her education by taking her in and paying the school fees. She finished her secondary schooling but going on to the University became impossible due to lack of funds. But she would not be stopped. &lt;p&gt;She found the Womens Vocational Education Center where she managed to enroll in a course to learn catering. She graduated after 2 years and is determined to use what she learned to start a business. She currently works Monday through Friday at Life in Africa and runs a small scale catering service on the weekends. She saved carefully and has been able to buy things she needed such as warmers, plates, forks, knives, and table cloths which she rents out to her customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her client list has grown and now she is ready to expand her small business. This will entail the purchase of more equipment so she will be able to cater to more customers and handle larger gatherings. For this reason she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;300 plates @ 1000/ ------------300,000/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;150 forks @ 1200/

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Esither is an active member of Life in Africa. She lives with her family in the Acholi quarters which is a camp for displaced persons from the wartorn North. Life is very difficult in the camps and the thousands who live there have very inadequate facilities and few services available to them. As a very observant person she has studied her community to see what services she could provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of her observations, she decided that the people living in the camp need to raise their self esteem. They need to be as smartly dressed and groomed as any other people living in Kampala. To this end she plans to open a men&apos;s saloon (barber shop). Her husband who currently toils in the rock quarry would run the business while she continues with her work at LiA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her plans include erecting a small room adjacent to her house where there is power available. She also will purchase a small generator so that the business can still run even with the current power crisis in Uganda. Currently there are only a few such businesses and customers have to wait a very long time to have their turn to get shaved. She will be able to service more people and can keep the prices low so they can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To complete this project she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000/=. She will be able to repay the loan in 12 months at a rate of 41,667/= per month.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her break down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Auma is an active member of Life in Africa. She is married and has six children. Originally she lived in Northern Uganda where there has been war for twenty years. Her father was killed in this war and soon after she came to Kampala in search of a safer place to live. Here she earned what money she could by working in the rock quarry and also by selling yellow bananas. These she carried in a basket on her head and she would walk miles each day in hopes of finding customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her life was very difficult and she barely earned enough to provide food for her children much less to pay school fees. But happily, she found Life in Africa and there she now earns a good living. Life has much improved for her and her family and money is now there for rent, food and even school fees for the children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her life improved, she started to have hope and allowed herself to start seeing a future. She carefully saved money and has acquired a plot of land in the Acholi quarters where she lives. On this land she plans to build a two room house for her family to live in. This will not only improve their standard of living but will enable the family to save the rent money they now pay each month. With this saved money the family hopes to build a permanent house in their home land when it is safe to return. For this project she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000. She will be able to repay this loan in one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is her budget in full:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Bricks 4000 @ 50/= ------------------- 200,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2- Iron sheets

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Doreen is an active member and worker at Life in Africa. She is currently employed in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She enjoys her work and the companionship she finds with the other workers and is happy that she is making a good living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She came to Kampala in 2003 when she had to flee her home in Northern Uganda because of the war. She was quite bored just sitting in the camps and so she tried working in the stone quarry to earn money. She found this work to be extremely hard physically. She still works the quarry but now hires others to do the actual labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is a good business woman and knows that she can make a success of a business that offers a needed service in her community. She plans to open a salon/barber shop. The profits from this business will allow her to save so that someday she can build a permanent home and possibly another house to rent out. To do this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are the budget in full:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;machine 2@

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Pamela is an active member of Life in Africa. She is currently working in the Invisible Children Bracelet project making bracelets and she is earning a good salary for her efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She live in the camp known as the Acholi Quarters where thousands who were forced to flee the war in the North have settled. She lives with her uncle but he has no work to do and so they are dependent on her income. She realizes that if there were some work for him to do their lives could be so much better and he would be happy to have work that would bring income to the household. And so she studied their situation and came up with a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groundnuts are consumed in great quantities by the Acholi. They grind these nuts and use them in sauces and nuts that are already ground are in good demand. Therefore, a local small scale business of grinding and packaging the groundnuts would be very suitable for her uncle to do. To accomplish this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to start the business. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He works as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. In his spare time he works at the rock quarry and he and his wife both make paper beads and hope to someday find a market for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is 36 years old and has four children. They live in the Acholi quarters which is a camp for people displaced by the war in the North. They have been their eight years arriving with nothing since they lost all their possessions when the rebels burned their home. Before joining Life in Africa, their life was horrible. They barely existed on one meal a day and had no money for things like clothes or school. His children now are amazed at how their life has changed. They now have clothes, shoes, mattresses to sleep on and they are able to eat three meals a day. But more important, the contact with other positive people and the sharing of skills and ideas have given them the courage to dream and plan for a future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their dream now is to have a proper house. Richard has saved enough to acquire a plot of land and he now plans to build a family home. Then with the money he saves on rent, he will save to build a second home to rent out which will add to their income and give them a more secure future. He has the skills to provide the labor himself and has already saved part of the money needed for materials. To complete this project he is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000/=. He will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is his budget in full:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Bricks 2000@ 60/= ------------ 120,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2- Cement 6 bags @ 18,000/= -------- 108,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 - Iron sheets 20 pcs. @ 10,000/= 200,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 - Roofing poles 10 pcs. @ 3,000/= 30,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 - Transport --------------- 42,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TOTAL -------------- 500,000/=&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his savings, He will buy the sand and the fittings. He also has some building skills, so he will be responsible for the labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard&apos;s loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by his community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala. He has designated the 25% community impact portion of the interest he will pay on this loan to support the WE Center Gulu.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

George is an active member of Life in Africa. He works in the Invisible Children Bracelet project as a sander and he is finally earning a good income for his family. He is a humble man and is dedicated to creating a new and better life for his family. His family was forced to flee the North where the rebels are waging war and they live in the camp known as the Acholi Quarters. He has a wife and six children he is supporting and he also has a brother who lives with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brother needs work to do and the additional income his brother could earn would greatly improve the life of the entire family. They have a plan to start a groundnut business which the brother can operate from their home. Groundnuts are a great favorite of the Acholi and as such are in great demand especially if they are already ground and packaged in small quantities making it affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This business will be local and small scale but has the potential to grow. To start this business he is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to purchase the equipment necessary. He will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is his break down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1, paste miller small size @ 350,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2, Small generator @

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Mom makes about $2 a day as a moto taxi driver. He anticipates that with his new tuk tuk he will be able to make $10 gross income, and he will have about $4 in expenses, which means he should make about $6 a day.

A large acreage of her farm is under tea but has set aside an area where she grows fodder for her cows which are zero grazed. Grace bought her cows from tea proceeds as well as the loans she got from Our Lady of Unity women group. To date, she has successfully repaid 9 loans from her group. Her previous loan was of USD 500. She gets USD 30 per month from sale of milk and USD 220 from tea. With the loan applied for, she intends to buy a water pump so as to be able to get water from a nearby river for her cows. This has been a problem due to the steep terrain of her farm. This will enable her better manage dairy cows and get more milk for sale. She also intends to buy farm inputs-fertilizers and cattle feed.&lt;/p&gt;

After investing his first $500 to have his house connected to the electricity network, he is now applying for a $1000 loan, whose main purpose is to improve their family house.

10pt&quot;&gt;W. is 52 years old a widow and has 6 children. She did her primary education and is the treasurer of Umoja women group. W. has struggled hard and has managed to educate 4 of her children, 2 up to college. She has been rearing the indigenous goats. When she joined Umoja women group she was trained on modern livestock management. Due to the vegetation devastation in Maasailand &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;women received training and prepared them for a positive change. W. is happy that the new changes will enable her educate all her children since the steers will give her more income. From rearing of indigenous goats, W. has now bought 3 steers with a loan of USD 180 that she received from her group and paid it back. Her aim is to reduce the number of goats and engage in selling steers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The milk market has improved and there are better terms of payment of dairy products offered by cooperative societies. She wants to replace in phases her dairy cows which on average produce 8 litres of milk per day with a better breed that can produce approximately 18 litres per day.

She was forced to drop out of school to take care of her youngest sister when her mother passed away. With her sister’s upbringing and education falling on her at such an early age, she sought for an income generating activity. She joined a women’s group and received basic business training courses that WEEC provided for its members.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In year 2003 Esther received her first loan of USD 60 to start a small business. She started a fruits business. She put her stall near Hardy supermarket so as to target those who want to buy fresh fruit other of the supermarket. The fruit business is doing well and has enabled her to educate her sister up to secondary level. Esther believes that discipline and hard work is the core of any business success. To this, she is the discipline mistress in her group. Esther’s dream is to expand her business to include cereals. She has started a special project of keeping local chicken and they are in high demand compared to broilers.

Nan is harvesting water spinach on a small piece of land she rent near to her house, in the outskirts of Phnom Penh City. She lives alone with her grown daughter, who is 23 years old and already employed in a sewing factory. In the morning, she gets up at 5am to harvest the water spinaches. She takes a break between 11am and 2pm, when the sun is too hot and then goes back to the field until 5pm to sow new plants. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;S.

are pleased to let you know that Keo Siphan was able to catch up on her payments for October, November, and December. The late payments were due to some confusion about how she was paying. She was trusting a neighbor to deliver her payments, and we had not received them. Thank you for your patience in this situation, and we will continue to keep you updated on Keo Siphan and her business.</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-02-23T08:29:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>7942</payment_id><comment>Payments for January and February</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-13T09:34:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10084</payment_id><comment>on time</comment></payment><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-04T08:00:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>15072</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>78</amount><local_amount>78</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>78</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>28003</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-07-02T18:51:18Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-07-02T09:15:12Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>4</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>521</id><name>Chandara</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;K.

The works have already begun but she needs additional funds to purchase materials and hire 2 workers to help her husband.

Sra. C.’s husband works as a cabinet maker and makes $120 every month. Anita has always had an entrepreneurial spirit, and once she married, she wanted to pursue her dream of opening a breakfast restaurant with her husband.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They began by running the small restaurant out of their home, but they realized 5 years ago that they would need a larger location to accommodate the growing number of customers that frequented their place. This husband-wife team has been able to improve their home which is in an area of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; called Isla Trinitaria. With the profits from business, Anita and her husband have been able to re-do the structure of their house to brick. She wants to borrow $585 so that she can put in new flooring in her house. The way things are right now, her family is very susceptible to flu and other throat sicknesses because the flooring is just dirt. Also, Anita would like to buy more utensils for her restaurant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, this 42 year-old mother of two lives with her husband in a marginalized area of the city referred to as Isla Trinitaria. Edeisi and her partner had to wait 10 years to obtain the title to their house as well as many other hardships. They lack potable water which costs $1 per tank, hygienic services, and a mode of transportation. Now 7 years widowed, Edeisi is left with her two children who are almost independent and her husband’s cabinet making business. When he passed away, Sra. B. still had possession of all of the tools, but she took the initiative in finding a worker who could continue the business to continue bringing in money for the family. One of her sons markets the finished products in the local markets. Edeisi is asking for this $365 loan to buy more wood to continue making cabinets as well as a polisher. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since she and her husband split, she has been responsible for their two children ages 6 and 7. A good friend of Yesenia’s encouraged her to open a fish market, and so she started a small business a few years back. Sra. Guadamaó opens shop at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;4:00 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and usually sells out by 1:00 pm. With her revenues from one day, Yesenia will buy fish for the next, but she would like to expand her offering by taking out a $365 loan. She wants to buy seafood like fish, shrimp, and shellfish like crab and scallops. This microloan will allow Yesenia to buy in cash, whereas now she currently purchases goods on credit for a one-day period and pays nearly double to settle the debt. She wants to strengthen her business and build a board with which she can display her fish. One of the side benefits of making more profit is that Yesenia can save enough money to fix the roof of her house and send her children to a better school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>707</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase more diverse supply of fish;

She is a 42 year-old single mother with 4 children, one of whom (7 years old) still lived in the household. Sra. R. has a fish business which she learned about from her parents. This long-time fish saleswoman of 15 years has been searching for a way to make greater profits so that she can provide for her children. Her daily routine is fairly normal; she wakes up at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;4:00 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to buy the catch for the day at which point she brings the fish to her market and sells it until around &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1:00 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. If she does not sell all of her fish at the market, she takes it home with her and finishes selling it there, she says. Mercis wants to take out a $475 loan to buy fish in cash and choose from the freshest fish around. Also, she wants to improve the presentation of her business to market the products better and bring in more clients. Mercis wants lenders to know that she is a very industrious woman who wants nothing more than to have her business succeed so that she can provide a better life for her children. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Irene is an active member of Life in Africa. She currently works in  the Invisible Children Bracelet project making bracelets and also dyeing the  materials they use. She is a young wife and as yet does not have children.  However, she hopes to and she wants to work now to secure a solid source of  income so that her children will not have to know poverty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her parents have given her a four room house but it is not finished.

This will also provide better housing for the families who  rent from her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To complete this house she is seeking a loan in the amount of 700,000.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Christopher is an active member of Life in Africa. He joined almost 6  months ago because of his passion for crafts and this has earned him a good job  as a bracelet maker for the Invisible Children Bracelet project. To suppliment  what he earns he also works part time in the stone quarry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He is 30 years old and was born in Northern Uganda. His childhood was stolen  from him by the rebels when they attacked, brutally killing most of his  relatives including his mother. He managed to survive but was forced to flee and  he ended up in the displaced persons camp in Kampala known as the Acholi  Quarters. Now he is married with four children of his own. They are all safe  from rebel attacks but they still live in horrible conditions in the camp. His  dream is to give his children what he has never had. A safe and permanent home  where they can live in peace.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He has acquired a plot of land and he plans to build a home for his children.  He has been saving and already has part of the money he will need. To add to his  savings he is seeking a loan in the amount ot 800,000.

They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition he plans to also sell  airtime cards for his clients who have cell phones. This will be a convenience  for them since they will not have to move to so many different places to have  their needs met. The sister is willing to work in this project at 30,000/= which  Arnold has accepted to pay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To accomplish this he is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva.

It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Peace komugisha’s way of life in  Kampala here was basically on local brew. She could make local brew, which is  bused so much by the people living in the slums of Kampala. Much as this local  brews consumed these city dwellers, peace got fed up with this type of business  as she find that dealing with drunkard persons is a very hard task.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She joined life in Africa four months ago after she had dropped the local  brew business and now working for the invisible children bracelet project as a  bracelet maker. By the time Komugisha dropped the business, she had saved  200,000/= that she wishes to use for the construction of a family house in her  village Mbarara. With the current job she has at Life in Africa her saving is  now 400,000/= She looks at this loan scheme as an opportunity for her to own her  dream house. With this regards she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000/=  that she is to repay in 12 months at a rate of 80000/= and below is her break  down:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;14 iron sheets of 32 gauge

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He and his family live in the camp known as the Acholi Quarters  where they live in a small rented house.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He has acquired a plot of land from the King of Buganda who has mercy for  these suffering people. He dreams of building a real home once again for his  children and he has been working diligently towards that goal. He has managed to  save 200,000 from his salary. Building this house will not only improve their  living conditions and give them a permanant home, but it will free up the money  they now have to pay for rent, which can be used to benefit the family.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is  a single mother of one child and is the sole support for herself and the child.  She was never able to be educated in her village and she longed for a better  life. So she left the village and moved to Kampala hoping to get an education  and a good job.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then her younger sister had to come and live with her and she had to give up  on her own education. Instead, she has put all her efforts into keeping her  sister and her child in school. This was very difficult since she had no steady  income. Then she found Life in Africa where she now works in the Invisible  Children bracelet project. The life has much improved but she knows she must do  more to achieve all her goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Her plan is to open a business dealing with millet which is in high demand  since it is a nutritious food source and is one of the staples of the Ugandan  diet. She has already found a building to rent. She will employ one person to  work the shop while she continues with her work at Life in Africa. She believes  that the added income will make life much easier and will insure that her sister  and child are able to finish school. For this project she is seeking a loan in  the amount of 800,000/= and she will be able to repay this loan in 12  months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Below is her Budget:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Millet grain 20 bags @30,000/= 600,000/= Saucepans 2 units @10,000/= 20,000/=  Transport 36,000/= Rent 70,000/=(5 months advance) Containers 2 units @30,000/=  60,000/= Cups 12 units @1,200/= 14,400/=&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Total 800,400/= Judith will pay the loan back in 12 months at the rate of  80,000/= per months WE Team to benefit: Education&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; WE Team to benefit: Adult Education &lt;br

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Steven is an active and hard working member of Life in Africa. He is  the proud father of one child and he is employed in the Invisible Children  bracelet project as a sander.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before coming to Life in Africa, he was a hawker. He walked miles each day  selling small personal items like hair pins, soap, perfume, sunglasses and other  items. The income he earned was what sustained his family but it was unreliable  and on some days he earned nothing. This made life difficult. Now, his income is  consistent and their lives have improved greatly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their biggest expense is the rent they pay for their small home. However, he  does own a home that is not finished since it still lacks a roof. He has been  saving to complete it. Once it is roofed, his family will be able to have a  better life with the money they will be saving on rent and they will also have  the pride of owning their own home. To complete this project he is seeking a  loan in the amount of 500,000/= and he will be able to repay this loan in 10  months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Below is his budget:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Iron sheets 30 units: 1 unit=11,000 330,000/= Labour 200,000/=&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Total 530,000/= At present he has saved 30,000/= to help with the same.  Steven will pay back this loan in full in 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;WE Team to benefit: Craft Production&lt;/p&gt;

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Her husband married another wife when Ruth failed to get many children. In 2003 she started a small business of selling green maize. She moved from house to house especially in parklands area selling. This work was very tedious and she decided to get a permanent stall in Rongai.

Her main customers are the casual workers who work in stone quarries at Rimpa, Gataka and those that live in Kware slum area. They pay her on a weekly basis as they get their wages. She intends to stock more items to cater for their demand. She also supplies the people who roast maize on the roadsides.

They moved in two weeks ago and have felt a critical need for housing improvement since their arrival. I. Somoul herself requested a $300 loan but she trusts her son to manage everything related to the works. He explained us he is going to buy for $250 of materials such as sand, cement, wood and zinc and hire two people from the community for 100,000 Riel ($25) for 1 week. He truly believes the works can be completed one single week after receiving the money from CREDIT.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;I.

She gets up early morning with her son and together they go to buy their fruits and vegetables at 4 am. She usually finishes at 5pm. She can make 20,000 Riel ($5) profit every day, while her son is making 10,000 Riel from taxi

The family eldest son is employed as a security guard in a night club in Phnom Penh.

married with four children. She lives in Kijichi area in Dar es Salaam. The area has no reliable water supply. By the help of her husband and her own savings she managed to buy a water tank and an electric pump. The current size of the tank is not sufficient to meet demand of water from residents.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;No public water system exist in the area. Erratic power supply which is experienced by all residents in Dar es Salaam also justifies the need for an additional storage tank and its accessories.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The additional tank will also provide an additional facility for treatment of water ready for domestic use. The project has a great value to the community as it provides a valuable resource need by each households and reduces incidences of water borne diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>773</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Water

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is a widow with 8 children. Her husband died from a motor accident in 2001. She is very skilled in handcrafts and makes such beautiful crafts like ladies bags, scarves, mats, baskets, beads, etc. She is currently renting a house in Nsambya, a suburb of Kampala. She earns her living and supports her family through earnings from the bracelet project at LiA and wholesale store near her place of residence that deals with foodstuffs like beans, cowpeas, maize and soyabeans. She needs to expand this business so as to be able to maintain her children in school, pay the house rent, feeding and clothing plus medicare. She is now seeking aloan in the amount of 800,000/= to expand this business and get more profits and increase her savings so that infuture, she can begin to build her own house so as to get rid of this rent business because, rent actually uses much more money that anything else in her life. These savings also would help with the ever increasing school fees for the children. Rose will be able to pay back this loan in 10 months. Below is her budget:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans 12 bags 60,000 - 720,000 Transport 84,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total 804,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loan use: e Expand Wholesale Food Store&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loan

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She joined Life in Africa in October 2004. She is a very talented designer especially gifted with tie and dye and, also makes awesome crafts. Her tie and dye fabrics are much sought after especillay by African women. Esther also works at Life in Africa with the invisible children bracelet project as a bracelet producer. she does earn an income that can help with the house expenses. Esther&apos;s challenge is that after making her tie and dye products, she needs to ask some one with a sewing machine to help her sew her beautiful into garments so she can put them up for sale. She then has to pay for this service by the sewing machine owner. If only she had her own machine, she would be producing lots good quality garments. This is the reason why she now seeks a loan in the amount of 800,000/= so she can have her own machine and buy materials to do this work without her having to pay for the service. This will also enable her to do her work much faster and more attention will be paid to it. Esther will be able to pay back this money in 12 months. Below is her budget:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sewing machine 400,000/= Material cloth 200,000/= Rent 150,000/= Contingencies 50,000/= Total 800,000/=&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE Team to benefit:

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Monyrort is a farmer. He is living with his wife, three children and two younger brothers in a village near to Phnom Penh. He is growing rice and vegetables and owns 4 cows, which are very useful to plough his parcels of land. When the cows are too old to work, he sells them for their meat. He is rather experienced in raising cows and would like to turn this activity into a profitable business. His wife is running her own business, selling water spinach, she can make $5 per day. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;C. Monyrort is requesting a $1,000 loan to buy an additional cow and to build a cow-house to shelter these precious animals. The cow will cost him between $500 and $700 while the materials (cement, wood and zinc mainly) for building the cow-house are worth $500. In addition to performing the works by himself, Monyrort will probably invest some of his own savings in the business too. The cow-house will be big enough for at least 10 animals and Monyrort might well buy one more with his next CREDIT loans.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>824</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>BUying

Chanthon has born ten children, six of them are still living with her. She is a widow and supports her family with a small business she is running with her four grown children. They sell dry food in front of the numerous factories in this area.
