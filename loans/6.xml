The jaggery will bring benefit to the community in general in addition to being a source of livelihood for his family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>7229</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Market</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Jaggery  </use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Myanga, Bugoma District, Kenya</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>27</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-14T23:45:33Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Christopher</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2006-12-29T21:27:33Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>450</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-01-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-29T08:33:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5584</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:33:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8900</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>150</amount><local_amount>150</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-29T09:25:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>150</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14169</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-29T09:16:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>18453</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26924</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-15T21:27:33Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-29T09:16:35Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2637</id><name>Brenda</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Brenda is married with 2 children.

After buying a piece of land in Ikapolok, he decided to abandon his 20 year barber business for one of vending tea leaves. The clients to the prior business usually came in between 7 pm and 10 pm making it difficult for him to connect home in the late hours. The first loan of US$143 guaranteed by his pastor enabled him to increase his stock of tea leaves for resale. Although profit margins were small he was able to repay the loan timely and to apply for another one. With the second loan of $225 he intends to purchase tea directly from the factory avoiding brokers. This will greatly improve his income by raising margins per 50Kg bag from $ 14 - $21.  We have seen a great change in his life and a turnaround in the family situation. He is able to support his family better and pay three laborers to help his wife in the farm.

Mama M. sells vegetable and fruits at her local market in Akites to support herself and 5 grandchildren (orphans) left behind by her children who died of HIV/AIDS. Her first loan of $ 43 from PEMCI was repaid timely. She has requested for a second loan of $150 to grow her vegetable business. Mama M. is a source of pride to us at her age she is not out begging for handouts to support these orphans to instead works hard. She deserves all the support she can get from us and we are very proud to be associated with her. She is also a source of encouragement and inspiration to other elderly grand mamas facing similar situation. We at Pemci are willing to help such elderly care givers to be self-sufficient.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>7238</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To boost vegetable sales </use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>: Akites, Chakol Division, Teso District</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>27</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-15T19:54:23Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Anna</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2006-12-29T22:18:30Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-01-29T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-29T08:34:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5591</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:33:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8909</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-29T09:25:23Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14176</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-29T09:16:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>18460</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26931</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-15T22:18:30Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-29T09:16:39Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2646</id><name>Aihan</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Aihan J. is 31 years old and lives in Kardjali.

She came to Kampala in1997 forcefully when especially her neighborhood homestead burnt down by Kony rebels and people lost their lives. The situation was so scaring and to remain was to loose life. She decided to come to Kampala where she settles at the suburb of Kampala known as Acholi quarters. While in this displaced place life has not been good because the way of earning living was not easy apart from stone quarry which is the only alternative to Acholi people in the suburb of Kampala. &lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But due to God’s will for his People, she joined life in Africa where sign of good life began to appear. She is a very active member and quick to learn whatever the community plans to do. She involved her self in learning how to make paper beads and other crafts that she became skilled in it and has become her monthly source of income. But still Jenny believes that she should not forget the stone quarry completely because that is where she started from and she knows enough about that business to know how to create more job opportunities in the stone quarry industry for the people of Acholi Quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her plan with this loan is to inject 500,000 in the stone quarry business as another side income and her production target is five trips per month. To realize her plan, she is seeking loan amount of 500,000/= that once given shall be repaid in 12 months.

In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She joined Life in Africa in March of this year, where she is earning a liittle money to supplement her income. She is a widowed mother of 5. Her husband passed away in late 2000. Life took a turn for the wose when this unfortunate event happened. All her realtives and in-laws left her all on her own and with 5 children, it was a tug of war to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She and her family had to leave the big house in which they were living before her husband passed on and began to put up in the garage so that, they rented out the larger part of the house so as to get some money to maintain themselves and also be able to send the children to school. However this Income is not enough to meet all of thier needs. Next to the big housae, there is a boys quarter that needs to be renovated so that she can rent it out to earn some money to help her in running her family. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She needs a loan in the amount of 500,000/= to accomplish this.&#13;&#10;Once this is done, it will go a long way to support her family and also reduce on the school fees pressures she has. Below is her budget:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;Bricks 1000pcs @50/= ..........50,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Sand 2 trips ..................100,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Cement 6 bags @18,000/= ......108,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Hardcore ......................50,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Timbers........................ 50,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Doors 2units ....................50,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Labour............................ 80,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Others.............................12,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Total 500,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>7246</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal Housing Expenses</activity><sector>Housing</sector><use>Construction materials and labor</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kisaasi</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.366667 32.583333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-12T07:41:31Z</posted_date><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Margaret</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2006-12-26T17:14:19Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>300</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>300</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-01-26T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-26T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>30</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-26T08:32:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-26T09:15:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5359</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:33:38Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-26T09:15:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8911</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-13T15:46:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-26T09:15:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>12921</payment_id><comment>&lt;p&gt;Dear Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

Jennifer hails from west Nile part of Uganda. She is a student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in business administration at Makerere university business school. She came to Kampala around 2002 after finding that there was nothing possible for her in her home district.&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While in Kampala things could not come normally. The desire to study and the pressure from burdens due to improper income. She started some causal work to help raise money for fees, rent, feeding and all the requirements needed in life but all the same, it was easy. By good luck, Jennifer got a friend by the names Abalo Florence who introduced her to life in Africa that she joined as a member and find that at Life in Africa; there is a lot of creativeness. Members teach each other how to make crafts out of recycling materials and she too took the idea. She has learnt how to make bracelets, paper beads and other craft products. She is now earning good living.&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where Jennifer B. stays at Nakawa quarters Kampala, is near where consumption of fire wood is very high because the nature of business there is local distillation of whisky that there is nothing used other than fire wood. So she is planning to start a fire wood scheme there since these distillers have to drive long way to look for fire wood. Jennifer is living with her mother who is also selling pancakes and along side this, her mother is ready to manage these businesses. &lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To make the plan a reality Jennifer is seeking a loan in the amount of 600,000/= and she will be able to repay in ten months.&#13;&#10;Below is the break down of her business:&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;-Three trips of firewood @

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

He hails from western part of Uganda and married with one child and his area of residence is kisaasi – Kampala. He joined Life in Africa early January 2006 by then he was working as a security officer with a private organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His joining Life in Africa was a blessing to him because he got to learn many things that he would not if he continued with security work. Much interesting one to him is his involvement in the community activities like bracelet making where he now earns some reasonable amount of money compared to that one of security. With this quick progress, Kenneth has three months ago opened a bar and sells a variety of drinks such as royal vodka, beer, soda and mineral water. Kenneth has saved at least three hundred thousand shillings that they wish to add in quantity of their stock because they have found that this business is profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His wife who is a bar attendant has at least five years experience in this business and handling drunkard people is like her professional job. On top of their 300000/= and what is in the bar, He is seeking a loan amount of 800000/= so that to have reasonable bar. Below is his total budget:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;Beer 15 Crates of beer @ 30,000/=... 450000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;20 Crates of soda @ 9600/=... 192000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Mineral water 15 Cantons @ 7000... 105000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Safi 15 boxes @ 6500... 97500/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Vodka 3 boxes @ 5000...15,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Plastic chairs 12...240,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Total...1099500/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;shs. 300,000 of this budget will come from the bar\&apos;s earnings so far; the rest is requested in the form of a kiva loan.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>7251</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pub</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>restocking a bar</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kisaasi</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>0.366667 32.583333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-14T00:50:53Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Kenneth</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2006-12-28T13:46:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>450</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-01-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-09T09:10:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-09T10:15:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>12615</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>1</amount><local_amount>1</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-14T20:23:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-09T10:15:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>12965</payment_id><comment>&lt;p&gt;Dear Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;On behalf of Life in Africa&apos;s WE Center Kampala community I offer an &lt;b&gt;apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva &#13;&#10;website&lt;/b&gt; over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of &#13;&#10;the transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this &#13;&#10;rather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you &#13;&#10;understand what&apos;s already happened, and what&apos;s happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this &#13;&#10;issue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have &#13;&#10;personally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it&apos;s now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we&apos;ve been dealing with.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In September 2006, &lt;b&gt;some LiA community members&lt;/b&gt; tasked to manage the loan program &#13;&#10;and the Invisible Children bracelet campaign &lt;b&gt;resigned amidst accusations of &#13;&#10;mismanagement&lt;/b&gt; from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  &#13;&#10;a laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center &#13;&#10;was closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted &#13;&#10;to another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the &#13;&#10;project with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Most LiA borrowers experienced&lt;/b&gt; a 1-3 month period after the September events &#13;&#10;when payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were &#13;&#10;delayed. Many fell into &lt;b&gt;arrears on their loans&lt;/b&gt; at that time. In most (but not &#13;&#10;all) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in &#13;&#10;the wake of September&apos;s disruption, the paper files for the loan program were &#13;&#10;also left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months &#13;&#10;for David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and &#13;&#10;get the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat &#13;&#10;back on track, so that &lt;b&gt;by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again&lt;/b&gt;. &#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Unfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has &#13;&#10;been in and out of &lt;b&gt;hospital&lt;/b&gt; since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance &#13;&#10;as full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another &#13;&#10;disaster - the &lt;b&gt;new accounts manager&lt;/b&gt; took over David&apos;s updated loan program records, and proceeded &#13;&#10;through &lt;b&gt;professional incompetence&lt;/b&gt; to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She &#13;&#10;resigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. &#13;&#10;We now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are &#13;&#10;riddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our &#13;&#10;borrowers have actually paid. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;After a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva&apos;s forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader/borrower who is  &#13;&#10;featured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she &#13;&#10;has dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa&apos;s communities in &#13;&#10;both Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, &lt;b&gt;Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program&apos;s administrative challenges by the horns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community &#13;&#10;members to figure out how to reconstruct the community&apos;s loan program records, so that more than &#13;&#10;one person understands the process that&apos;s been used and everyone can agree on &#13;&#10;the final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on &#13;&#10;behalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she&apos;s investing in &#13;&#10;getting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and &#13;&#10;for all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this &#13;&#10;morning. Instead, &lt;b&gt;Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal &#13;&#10;directly for lenders&apos; patience&lt;/b&gt;. They feel that getting this sorted out &#13;&#10;right means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records &amp; recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt; To avoid that ALL of our members&apos; online &#13;&#10;records are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative &#13;&#10;crisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to &#13;&#10;this month on the Kiva website. &lt;/b&gt; The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that &#13;&#10;each of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower&apos;s actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month&apos;s payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full &#13;&#10;and actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA &#13;&#10;community in 2006. &lt;b&gt;In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;I humbly hope you can &lt;b&gt;forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges&lt;/b&gt; we&apos;ve faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we&apos;ve already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Meanwhile, any &lt;b&gt;lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering&lt;/b&gt; with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&quot;&gt;http://www.omidyar.net/group/lia/&lt;/a&gt;.

She is married with three children and her most occupation is local farming. She came to Kampala in 2000 as the result of war in northern Uganda. Since 2000, she has been settled at Banda Zone One, Nakawa Division. Both her and her husband, have been doing hard work like stone quarry and pottery work like carrying water from the well to the area where needed.&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When A. joined Life in Africa, she begun experiencing an easier life because instead of over working, she could just do little work and get some money out of the beads she is making both at nome and as the group production at the WE center Kampala, she says she has actually acchieved alot from the activities at the center. She met many friends in such a short time and acquired so many skills that has enabled her to start developmental ideas. &lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A. feels that if she puts more money into the stone quarry that her husband is still continuing with, she believes that she will be able to go very far, she infact intends to build a house of her own after getting more money from the business that she is planning to do. she would like to boost her husband with more money so that they can achieve more from the quarry business and he too gets a bit of relief while involving more people to help him and hence creating jobs for more people.&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She therefore seeks a loan of 500,000/= to acomplish her plans. she will be able to pay the loan back in 12 months.&lt;p/&gt;&#13;&#10;Below is her Budget in full :&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Buying quarry site ---------------- 150,000/=&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Digging stones from pit ----------

First this factory was property of the state and  so was the shop. Anelia has worked as a manager of this shop for more than 15 years. Eight years ago the factory was sold to private owners and they had no interest to the shop so Anelia got the option to rent it and to work for herself. Then she started her business. The staff of the factory is about 600 workers and all of them are customers to the shop. Anelia is divorced and has three children. Her elder daughter who is 17 years old helps her with the business. Because of this shop Anelia is able to look after her three children. The loan she applies for she will use to buy a sweets show case – icecreams, cakes, creams. The loan amount is $ 1000.

She first started with trade. In 2002 she found a shop on the trade street of Jambol on which she started to sell bags, purses and other leather goods. This summer while she was on vacation Velichka saw booths for Internet phone calls on streets of summer resorts and decided to start this service in her native town. Five months ago she closed the shop and on the same place she installed four booths for internet phone calls. Because of the strategic situation of the place the business is going very well so far. She has no competition in the town. Now Velichka wants to install another phone booth and applies for a loan. The amount is $ 850.

Two years ago he stopped being a farmer and became a business man; the price of meat dropped due to Russia banning the importation of Moldovan meats.  Nicolae owned a building on a heavily traveled road on the outskirts of Ungheni.  This building consisted of a grocery store and a separate room which had booths and tables for customers to relax and enjoy the products bought at the grocery store.  He always rented out this building but two years ago he decided to stop renting and open his own business at this location. &#13;&#10;He hired two employees (one is in the photo with Nicolae) and took the chance of becoming an entrepreneur.  Business has been great and his business is growing, except the refrigerator which stores the dairy products, meats and other perishable products is old and is in need of replacement.  He would like a loan to purchase a new refrigerator and inventory of existing and new products especially those that people will consume during Post.

She looks forward to the day when she will have more machines and will even offer tailoring lessons to HIV+ widows and orphans in her community.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>7379</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To boost her stock  </use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Lukolis-Chakol, Kenya</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>27</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-23T23:44:57Z</posted_date><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Roseline</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-07T07:02:36Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>225</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-06T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-06T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-06T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>37.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-02-07T10:30:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>6852</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-07T10:30:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9552</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-07T09:25:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>15359</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>38</amount><local_amount>38</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-07T09:16:03Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>38</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21277</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>35</amount><local_amount>35</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>35</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>29940</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-24T07:02:36Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-07-07T09:17:36Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2699</id><name>Antonio</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Antonio has a spot at a local market where he sells jewelry, laces and other items.

He is married and has an elder boy and a girl. Lubomir is in entertaining business for more than twenty years. Previously he has been a barman and manager in many restaurants on the east sea coast and later he had a fruit and vegetable trade business. A serious disease made him stop for a while and when he recovered he had lost his business contacts. Then Lubomir decided to do the business he knew best. Two years ago he rented the coffee bar in the Bourgas Theatre House. The coffee bar is small but cosy and its regular customers are people of artistic sphere. It is a family business and Lubomir’s wife and two kids also work in it. Now Lubomir wants to make repairs in the coffee bar and needs a $ 2 000 loan.

It is not so big but offers quality clothes and has lots of visitors. Last year Asen opened another similar shop in one of city’s biggest quarters.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This loan will be shared by the ten members of the Magui Demb tontine, or women’s savings association.  Represented by their leader Fatou  N. M., the Magui Demb group describes their business: &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We are a group of women who have formed a GIE [Groupement d’intérêt économique or Economic Interest Group, the term for a legally registered commercial group in Senegal] and have common business activities, which consist of a trading operation [i.e. retail sale of local products such as garden produce, dried fish, peanuts and palm oil from street-side stands] that we conduct with the total amount of our tontine’s funds, for which we collect dues of 1000 francs [US $1.92] per person every Sunday.  Our purpose is to build up our working capital fund in order to increase our income.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;We plan to make trips to Gambia or Mauritania in order to purchase cloth of all kinds – wax [a colorful printed cotton cloth made in the Netherlands which has become wildly popular in West Africa for use as skirts], basin [a ribbed damask cloth used for men’s robes], brodé [a rich embroidered cloth used for robes and caps], and voile [a thin silk cloth used for women’s veils].  This merchandise will in turn be resold in the heart of our local area, as we have long been accustomed to do.”&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Original French:&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;« Contexte du Projet : Nous sommes un groupement de femmes qui se sont constituées en GIE (Groupement d’Inter Economique) et avons des activités communes à savoir le commerce que nous exerçons avec le total des sommes des sommes de notre tontine dans la quelle nous cotisons 1000f par personne touts les dimanches.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10; Objectifs du Prêt : Notre objectif est de renforcer notre fond de roulement pour augmenter nos revenus.  &lt;p&gt;Activités : Nous prévoyons de faire des voyages en Gambie ou en Mauritanie afin de pouvoir acheter des tissus de tout genre (Wax, Basin, Brodé et voile) Ces marchandises, en revanche serons revendues à l’intérieure de notre localité comme nous avons l’habitude de le faire. »&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Background&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Senegal is one of the world’s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal’s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

She started her business ten years ago with one sack of rice and another of sugar. She has continuously reinvested many of her profits into her business in order to make it grow. Today her product line continues to include groceries but also extends into basic school and office supplies. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ana is interested in taking out a loan so she may continue to invest in foods but also to explore sales of new items. She feels that selling clothes from her business may be very successful in her part of the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ana is 32 years old, is married and has 4 children.

From an early age, her mother taught her all about trading, and after the death of her parents, she took sole responsibility for her two brothers and three sisters, which forced her to consider running a business. Today, Miss D. has her own bar that she would like to expand. Despite her illiteracy, this young woman is a conscientious manageress, and is well-respected in her community. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Miss D. is asking for a loan of $650 to buy religious artifacts and wine. This will increase her income so that she can take better care of her unfortunate brothers and sisters. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Alison Dent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mlle D.

Very early on, she started small business activities to meet her own needs. As she had very limited means, she chose an activity that requires very few resources: preparing and selling maize porridge, donuts and cake. Later she got married to alleviate her hardship. But she realized later that she had chosen the wrong husband. The man abandoned her with nine (9) children. Staggering under the burden, she can no longer cope and is seeking help. Despite the profitability of her business, revenue is very scanty compared to her household\\\&apos;s needs. To increase the revenue, she got a credit of $150 that she managed very well and paid back successfully. The second credit of $300 gave her a breath of fresh air and allowed her to sell essential products in addition to porridge. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The credit of $550 she is requesting will allow her to buy wheat flour, sugar, rice, oil cans and other consumer products. This will allow significant growth of her revenue and improve her living conditions and those of her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Née en 1950 d’une famille nombreuse et pauvre, Madame A. Essi n’a pas eu la chance d’aller à l’école. Elle se lança très vite dans le petit commerce pour subvenir à ses propres besoins. Limitée par les moyens, elle choisit une activité qui ne demande pas beaucoup d’argent : la préparation et la vente de bouillie de maïs, de beignets et de gâteaux. Entre temps, elle se maria pour atténuer ses peines. Elle se rendra compte plus tard qu’elle a choisit le mauvais homme. Aujourd’hui, mère de neuf (09) enfants, elle est abandonnée par son mari. Ecrasée par toutes ces charges, elle n’en peut plus et crie au secours. Malgré la rentabilité de son activité, le revenu est très insignifiant par rapport à l’importance des besoins de son ménage. Et pour augmenter ses revenus, elle bénéficia d’un crédit de $ 150 qu’elle avait géré et parfaitement remboursé. Le second crédit de $300 lui a donné un buffet d’oxygène et lui a permis de vendre en plus de la bouillie, des produits de première nécessité.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Le crédit de $550 sollicité lui permettra d’acheter la farine de blé, de sucre, du riz, bidon d’huile et des produits de première nécessité. Ce qui d’augmentera considérablement ses revenus et lui permettra d’améliorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.

Having never attended school, her businesses is cassava processing, called «cassava flour». She learned this from her mother 30 years ago. Not having the land or the strength to farm cassava, she requests a loan of $ 950 to strengthen her capacity to buy a cassava farm in order to grow her production and income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Since that career is difficult and dangerous, she requests a grater which will be used by all the village women. So, the requests will serve to buy cassava farm and realization of this project will contribute greatly to her family living condition improvement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated by Farron Blanc &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mariée et mère de quatre (04) enfants, Madame K. Efua, âgée de 42 ans est la 2ème femme de son mari. N’ayant jamais mis pied à l’école, elle a comme activité la transformation du manioc en farine appelée « gari ». Elle a hérité cette activité de sa maman depuis 30 ans. N’ayant pas de force ni de terrain pour faire elle-même la culture du manioc, elle sollicite un crédit de $950 pour renforcer son pouvoir d’achat de champs de manioc afin d’accroître sa production et de facto augmenter ses revenus. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aussi, ce métier étant difficile et dangereuse, elle sollicite une râpeuse qui sera mise à la disposition de toutes les femmes du village. Ainsi, le crédit sollicité servira à acheter des champs de manioc et à acquérir une râpeuse. Il est tout à fait évident que la réalisation de ce projet contribuer énormément à l’amélioration de ses conditions de vie de sa famille.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

He has mastered the new technologies of motors bought from Asia which currently cover the Togolese market, he stays in line with his client’s needs.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Kenjong owns a small business selling natural juices. Throughout the year he will sell orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and watermelon juices to his customers, as he has done for the last 16 years. When Mr. P. moved from Manabi to Guayaquil, he was without work for quite some time. Desperate and in need of work, Kenjong was walking near one of the local universities one day and noticed the large number of students buying things from the local vendors. The next day he brought a table, plastic cups, a juicer, and 100 oranges to begin selling fresh-squeezed orange juice to the college kids. Every day from 7am until 10pm for the past two years, Kenjong has been at this location, paying $112 a month in rent. Sometimes in the afternoon his wife will help him run the juice stand, and she has enabled him to get legal advice from a lawyer that she works with. With two sources of income coming in, the Pins lead a modest but fulfilling life. Kenjong thanks God every day because his juice stand has changed his life and given him opportunities that he never had before. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is asking for this loan so that he can open a true location without paying high monthly rent and buy a new juicer, since the one he had for 10 years is wearing down. Additionally, he has plans to open another branch location once he earns enough from his current operation. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kenjong is a 39 year-old entrepreneur with two children and a loving, supportive wife. They own their own house, and thanks to the success he has had at the juice stand, Kenjong was able to reinforce the house with cement. They want people to know that thet are a very hard-working family and that they use their money wisely to plan for future endeavors, such as expanding the business to new branch locations across Guayaquil. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>7512</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>He is asking for this loan so that he can open a true location without paying high monthly rent and buy a new juicer, since the one he had for 10 years is wearing down.

Her husband, a volunteer teacher in a private school where the pay is unpredictable, is unable to meet the needs of his household.  Ms A. takes care of her younger sister and her grandmother, who raised them from the age of five. Having left primary school owing to a lack of means, at a young age she began a second-hand clothing business, which she now operates successfully.  She has had three previous loans, all quickly paid off without difficulty.  She is evidently a trustworthy woman deserving of financial support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is now asking for a loan of $900, to buy bales of used clothing directly from the port of Lomé, so as make a bigger profit. In this way Ms A. will increase her income, enabling her to provide for the education of her two children and her younger sister, and to cover her grandmother’s medical expenses.  In short, she will be able to improve their quality of life.  She would then have enough money to seek out and bring home her mother, who left the country without any indications of her whereabouts and has not been heard from since.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel KUEY/J.V. Guy-Bray.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Née le 27 juillet 1981, Madame A. Adjo est mère de deux (02) enfants. Son mari, un enseignant volontaire dans une école privée aux salaires irréguliers, n’arrive pas à subvenir au besoin de son foyer. Elle a à sa charge sa petite sœur et sa grand-mère qui les a élevés depuis l’âge de 5 ans. Ayant arrêté ses études au cours primaires par manque de support, elle s’est lancée très tôt dans le petit commerce de friperie qu’elle maîtrise très bien aujourd’hui. Elle avait bénéficié par le passé de trois crédits promptement remboursés sans incident. Elle fait preuve d’une femme de confiance et mérite d’être soutenue financièrement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elle sollicite aujourd’hui un crédit de $900 qui servira à acheter des balles de friperie directement au port de Lomé pour en tirer plus de bénéfice. Ce faisant ainsi, Madame A. augmentera ses revenus lui permettant d’assurer l’éducation de ses deux enfants et celle de sa petite sœur, à faire face aux soins médicaux de sa grand-mère, bref, à améliorer leur cadre de vie. Elle pourra ainsi disposer de moyens pour chercher et ramener aux bercails, sa mère qui a quitté le pays sans laisser de trace et sans faire signe de vie.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>7513</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used

A la demande de sa clientèle, Madame G. a adjoint à la coiffure et à la tresse, la vente de mèches et d’accessoires de coiffure. Ce qui nécessite des moyens financiers plus consistant qu’elle ne dispose pas actuellement. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pour ce faire, G. Sarah sollicite un crédit de $ 850 qui servira évidemment à l’achat d’un séchoir, des mèches et autres accessoires afin de faire face à une demande sans cesse croissante de sa clientèle à cette période des fêtes de fin d’année.

After his training in carpentry, he didn’t succeed in opening a workshop because his uncles and aunts refused to help him. Today, at age 36, he continues to offer help in carpentry projects both at construction sites and in the workshops of master carpenters. This situation is very trying for him because he has no fixed income, even though he must feed his wife and his three (3) children. Education and health care for the children are a difficult problem for Mr. A.. Talented and full of initiative, he wishes to establish himself in his own name by opening his workshop to assure his own development and the future of his children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;That is why he requests a credit of $1200 to rent the premises and acquire the necessary modern tools for his workshop. Helping Mr. A. to open his own workshop means helping him develop his talent and improve living conditions for his family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monsieur A. Ayi Antoine a interrompu ses études au Lycée lorsqu’il n’avait plus personne pour le soutenir après la mort de ses parents. Après sa formation en menuiserie, il ne parvient pas à s’installer car ses oncles et tantes refusent de l’aider. Aujourd’hui âgé de 36 ans, il continue de faire l’aide menuisier soi sur les chantiers de construction, soit dans les ateliers des  maîtres menuisiers. Cette situation est très éprouvante pour lui car il n’a pas un revenu fixe alors qu’il doit nourrir sa femme et ses trois (03) enfants. La scolarisation des enfants, les soins de santé sont un problème difficile pour Monsieur A.. Talentueux et plein d’initiative, il veut s’installer en son propre compte par l’ouverture de son atelier pour assurer son épanouissement et l’avenir de ses enfants.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;C’est pourquoi, il sollicite un crédit de $1200 pour louer le local, acquérir des outils modernes nécessaires à son établissement. Permettre à Monsieur A. d’ouvrir son propre atelier, c’est l’aider à faire éclore tout son talent et améliorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>7515</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Carpentry</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>to

Every week she features a new item in her store, something distinct that she knows her customers cannot find anywhere else. Elsa gains loyal customers from the nearby open-air market, festival celebrations, and street traffic. With five years of experience under her belt, Elsa runs a very tight operation. Having been left by her husband seven years ago, Ms. R. has done very well as a single mother trying to raise three children. Life continued to throw challenges in Elsa’s way when her daughter of 14 had a baby. Rather than complain and quit, this hard-working entrepreneur pulled herself up and put extra effort into her job to raise her children and grandchild. Elsa’s parents run a similar shop in Guayaquil, and they were able to advance her some inventory of clothes to help her get started in her own business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ms. R. is asking for this loan so that she can incrementally increase the volume of her business. She plans to buy seasonal clothes such as sweaters and rain jackets, and if she pays in cash, she cant benefit from the distributor’s discounts. Elsa is 41 years of age, and although she has experienced many hardships in life, she wants people to know her for working hard and supporting her three children, all of whom attend school and enjoy good health. They live in a modest house which was passed down from Elsa’s mother, but this house is the focal point of her small business which Elsa hopes to grow into a very profitable venture.  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>375</funded_amount><paid_amount>375</paid_amount><image><id>7516</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Ms. Rivera is asking for this loan so that she can incrementally increase the volume of her business.

Married and the mother of two children, she is in the cereals business.  Energetic, open, honest, and with a keen management sense, Ms A. runs her business very effectively.  Currently, a strong demand for frozen food has arisen in Aklakou, and Ms A. quickly recognized an opportunity.  She therefore wishes to serve her customers by opening a shop for selling frozen products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This new project requires financial resources that Ms A. does not possess. For this reason she is asking for a $1,200 loan to acquire a freezer and to stock up with fish, chicken, and other frozen products for retail sale. This new activity is sure to increase her household income and will improve her living conditions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel KUEY/J.V. Guy-Bray.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mme A. Mawulé est née en 1975 à Aklakou. Mariée et mère de 02 enfants, elle a pour profession le commerce des céréales. Dynamique, ouverte, sincère et ayant le sens aigu de la gestion, Mme. A. maîtrise parfaitement son activité qu’elle gère avec efficacité. Aujourd’hui, une forte demande en produits congelés s’est révélée à Aklakou et Mme. A. l’a vite compris. Elle souhaite alors satisfaire sa clientèle en ouvrant une boutique de vente des produits congelés.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ce nouveau projet nécessite des moyens financiers que Mme. A. ne dispose pas. C’est pour cela qu’elle sollicite un crédit d’un montant de $1200 qui va lui servir à acheter un congélateur et à s’approvisionner en poisson, poulet et autres produits congelés pour la revente. Cette nouvelle activité augmentera à coup sûr le revenu du ménage de Mme A. et améliorera ses conditions de vie.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>7518</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

Handicapped in her lower limbs, she has never taken into account this infirmity and works hard to contribute to the household expenses. Married and mother of four (4) children, she runs a shop for cold beverages and liquor. Joyful and welcoming, she knows how to attract customers through the quality of service she offers. Despite her illiteracy, she has good management sense and has succeeded in promptly repaying the credit that she has received in the past without any incidents. As the end-of-year holidays approach, Mrs. Poovi A. knows that the demand will be very high and would like to increase her stock of beverages.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is why she is requesting a credit of $950 to buy supplies in bulk and have a large stock of beverages before, during and after the Christmas and New Year holidays. The business will flourish during this period and will allow her to increase the household income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Poovi est née en 1950 à Glidji dans la préfecture des Lacs. Handicapée de ses membres inférieurs, elle n’a jamais tenu compte de son infirmité et travaille ardemment pour contribuer aux charges du ménage. Mariée et mère de 04 enfants, elle tient une boutique de vente de boissons frais et de liqueur. Joviale et accueillante, elle sait attirer la clientèle à travers la qualité du service qu’elle offre. Malgré son analphabétisme, elle a le sens d’une bonne gestion et a su rembourser promptement et sans incident les premiers crédits qu’elle avait eus par le passé. A l’approche des fêtes de fin d’année, Mme A. Poovi sait que la demande sera très forte et voudrait augmenter son stock de boissons. &#13;&#10;Aussi, sollicite-t-elle à cet effet un crédit de $950 pour s’approvisionner en gros et disposer d’un stock important de boissons avant, pendant et après les fêtes de Noël et de Nouvel. L’activité sera florissante à cette période et permettra d’améliorer le revenu du ménage&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>7519</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft

Antonyna is a Technical school graduate. She used to work as a crane operator. Then she changed her job and worked as a salesperson in a grocery store. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Antonyna began selling clothing and shoes for women in the outdoor market in 2003. Her business has grown steadily and has been a stable source of income. Antonyna invests money in her daughter’s education; she believes it’s the best investment. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Antonyna is dynamic, persevering and responsible. She has had several loans from Nadiya Ukraine and has maintained a perfect credit history. She believes the loans she has received have been very important in helping her build her small business and she tells her entrepreneur friends about Nadiya Ukraine’s lending services. Antonyna now needs a loan to add new clothing items to her inventory for the busy holiday season.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антоніна - одружена. В неї є 18-річна донька, яка вчиться в університеті. Антоніна отримала середньо-технічну освіту. Працювала кранівницею. Потім змінила місце роботи, працювала продавщицею в магазині. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антоніна почала продавати одяг та взуття для жінок на ринку ще в 2003 році. Її бізнес поступово розвивався, почав приносити стабільний прибуток. Антоніна з радістю інвестує гроші в навчання своєї донечки; вона вважає, що це - найкраща інвестиція. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антоніна - дуже динамічна, наполеглива та відповідальна людина. Вона виплатила усі позики, які отримала в \\\&quot;Надії України\\\&quot;, тому вона має чудову кредитну історію. Вона вірить, що отримані нею позики відіграли важливу роль у розвитку її малого бізнесу. Антоніна розповідає своїм &#13;&#10;друзям-підприємцям про кредитні послуги, які пропонує \\\&quot;Надія України\\\&quot;. Антоніна просить про позику тому, що хоче вкласти гроші в купівлю нового одягу та взуття, які користуються особливим попитом напередодні Новорічних та Різдвяних свят.

She runs the administrative part of the business while her husband is in charge of production. This operation all got started about 8 years ago. At the time, her husband would only make furniture out of wood, but he got a customer that asked him to make a tv stand out of metal. Because he had some experience with metalwork he took the job. Once he finished, he realized that working with metal was much faster and easier than wood and therefore more profitable. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today they have four employees (3 of them pictured next to Martha) that work with them and get paid by commission. They sell most of their products in their community and also in nearby rural towns. They need the loan in order to invest in paints and raw materials for their operation. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Martha is 28 years old and has 2 small children. Her husband is a hard working family man who has dedicated most of his time and efforts to this microenterprise.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Victor R. has 25 years of experience selling shoes, clothes, and he started working in Bahia, Ecuador. He worked for a boss who had the idea to work on foot and sell shoes in the local pueblos. After breaking off from this small business, Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, and they followed a similar model from Victor’s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly whichi towns were the most lucrative, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally. Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor’s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically goes to the small towns and local festivals which occur fairly often. They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained strong over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Victor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  He is a 48 year-old with four children, who of whom work for the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. They saved enough money to move out of Victor’s mother-in-law’s house, which was putting pressure on everyone. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own. The Riveras are proud to have gotten out of their previouos situation, which was dire poverty. Although they are still poor, they enjoy a standard of living that most do not have in Ecuador. Their wish is to continue growing the business and open a store located next to their house.

She is married and a mother of three children, two of whom are in college, the other is still in primary school. She is the group treasurer of WEEC, and since joining the group in 2003 she has executed her duties as treasurer diligently and responsibly. Cecilia is due to complete her first loan of USD735 this month. Together with her husband, she used this loan to open a pub and guesthouse at Kanunga in 1995. Her business has allowed her and her husband to raise and educate their children. Cecilia is very good at marketing, and she has been able to interact with many people while also converting them into customers. She knows how to handle all types of people and she treats them with dignity and respect, attracting many to come back time and again to her pub and guest house. With the loan of USD 450, Cecilia intends to buy more drinks to cater to her growing number of customers. She is willing to repay her loan on monthly basis.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>7716</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pub</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Cecilia

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Valyeryi is single. He lives with his parents. His father works at a factory and gets minimum salary, his mother is a housewife. The money they both earn is not enough to meet their needs. Valyeryi willingly contributes to the expenses of his family. His primary goal has always been to give his family a better standard of living. After Valyeryi got back from the military, he worked in a firm selling flower seeds and fertilizers. The experience he gained in this work gave him the confidence he needed to start his own small business and master his commercial activities efficiently.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Valyeryi is very hard-working and enterprising. He works in his greenhouses day and night. He always says his work is something that gives him enthusiasm and inspiration, for it brings beauty into the world. In summer, Valyeryi sets up stalls in the open markets of the city selling the flowers and plants he has grown. Usually it provides a seasonal job and a decent salary for one or two free lancers. Valyeryi has succeeded in managing his previous loans in “Nadiya Ukraine” and repaid all of them without any delinquencies. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Valyeryi is eager to access the above amount to buy more flower seeds and bulbs. He is planning to expand the surface he cultivates for greater production. Valyeryi is going to grow potted and cultivated flowers in the greenhouses and sell them in summer. This loan will help him get a wider variety of flowers and a larger quantity of plants. Moreover, the loan will give Valyeryi a chance to improve his greenhouses to protect them against ups and downs of the climate, particularly drops in temperature. Valyeryi will benefit from more consistent financial support because it will strengthen his trade and provide the important profit margin he needs to improve his business.    &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; Валерій неодружений. Він живе з батьками. Батько працює на заводі, отримує мінімальну зарплатню. Мати – домогосподарка. Грошей, які вони заробляють вдвох, усе одно не вистачає на основні потреби. Валерій охоче допомагає родині фінансово. Для нього завжди головним було забезпечити рідних. Після повернення з армії Валерій працював на фірмі, яка продавала насіння квітів та добрива. Досвід, який він отримав, дав йому впевненість у власних силах для того, щоб почати свій бізнес та ефективно ним керувати.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Валерій – дуже працьовитий та заповзятливий. Він працює в своїх теплицях вдень і вночі. Валерій завжди повторює, що робота – це те, що надихає його та сповнює ентузіазму, бо квіти дарують світові красу. Влітку Валерій торгує на ринку, він продає квіти, які виростив взимку. Зазвичай це забезпечує місце роботи та гідну зарплатню для ще одного або двох реалізаторів. Валерій виплатив усі попередні позики в „Надії України” без жодного прострочення. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Валерій хотів би отримати вищевказану суму для того, щоб закупити більше насіння квітів. До того ж він планує розширити розміри теплиць та збільшити обсяги виробництва. Валерій хотів би вирощувати кімнатні та садові рослини, а потім продавати їх влітку. Позика допоможе йому виростити інші різновиди квітів та  рослин. Окрім цього, завдяки позиці Валерій зможе покращити стан теплиць та захистити їх від кліматичних коливань, особливо низьких температур. Позика сприятиме розвитку бізнесу Валерія, бо фінансова підтримка зміцнить торгівлю та принесе йому прибуток необхідний для подальшого росту бізнесу.

Traditionally that day is not Monday; an old superstition in Moldova is that if one receives money on Monday one will not make any additional money for the rest of that year.  In Ungheni, a regional center on the Romanian border, the market day is Thursday. On Thursday the merchants have no time off.  From 8:00 - 5:00 they are working non-stop, on their feet without a break, and set up starts even earlier.   Anna B. is one of those merchants, and has been working at her booth for over 5 years. Ana is 56 years old with a husband and a daughter. Her daughter has a nearby stall selling fabrics and yarn and they help each other out, running back and forth through the market to watch over both booths while one of them has a break from the very hectic day.  At Anna\&apos;s stall she sells mostly Moldovan made cloths, but has recently started to sell linens, bedclothes, and blankets which come from a local vendor.  These products are very popular and Anna would like to concentrate on only selling this merchandise. She would like a loan to purchase a larger shipment of these kinds of goods.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1875</funded_amount><paid_amount>1875</paid_amount><image><id>8041</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Вона дбає про батька похилого віку, який живе з нею. Вікторія закінчила технікум. Заробляє на життя продажем одягу для дітей та жінок. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Якийсь час Вікторія працювала вихователем в дитячому садку. Потім пішла на іншу роботу, почала працювати в магазині. Врешті решт вирішила почати свій власний бізнес та продавати одяг на ринку. Її бізнес є основним джерелом прибутку для родини.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Вікторія – талановитий підприємець, має чудову репутацію. Вона дуже люб’язна та ввічлива з клієнтами.

Вона просить 1000 доларів для того, щоб ще більше урізноманітнити асортимент товарів напередодні святкового сезону. Отримання позики сприятиме розвитку її бізнесу та допоможе Вікторії забезпечити потреби своєї родини.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>8045</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase inventory for Christmas season</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-19T07:43:58Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Victoria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-04T20:56:39Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-22T08:31:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>4833</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:42:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8949</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-22T09:25:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13468</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>332</amount><local_amount>332</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>332</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25344</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-21T20:56:39Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-22T09:15:51Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2802</id><name>Tamina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Tamina B. is  42 year-old married woman and a mother of 2 school-children.

With increased sales I hope to pay for my two sons to go to school, they are now coming of age.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>225</funded_amount><paid_amount>225</paid_amount><image><id>8071</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase deodorants, lotions, creams, perfumes, soap, make-up, kitchen utensils and towels. </use><location><country_code>HN</country_code><country>Honduras</country><town>Tegucigalpa</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>14.1 -87.216667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>5</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-21T18:36:08Z</posted_date><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Delia Del Carmen</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-04T19:27:01Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>225</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>225</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>56.25</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>57</amount><local_amount>57</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-21T08:33:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>57</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>4818</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>57</amount><local_amount>57</local_amount><processed_date>2007-02-21T15:25:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>57</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>7766</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>57</amount><local_amount>57</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-21T15:30:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>57</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>11109</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13438</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-21T19:27:01Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-04-21T11:28:27Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2806</id><name>Zenaida Rubi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>English Translation:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;My name is Zenaida R.

My goal is to increase my inventory so that I can save enough money to remodel my house, support my family, and pay for a good education for my daughter.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>250</funded_amount><paid_amount>250</paid_amount><image><id>8085</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase bananas, beans, butter, cheese, tortillas, plates, cups, salt, sugar, meat, bread and coffee for my food stand.</use><location><country_code>HN</country_code><country>Honduras</country><town>Tegucigalpa</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>14.1 -87.216667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>5</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-22T00:32:02Z</posted_date><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Romana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-05T05:45:12Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>250</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>250</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-04T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-04T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>41.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-22T08:31:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>4838</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-02-23T16:46:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>7967</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-24T04:12:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>11625</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-23T15:41:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13539</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>42</amount><local_amount>42</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-22T12:58:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>42</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17026</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>40</amount><local_amount>40</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>40</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25256</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-22T05:45:12Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-22T09:15:01Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2813</id><name>Kwamina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Kwamina sells fresh coconut juice to workers in the Governmental and non-governmental organizations offices in Ghana.

The money I earn from selling pillows helps me to support my family,and my goal is to slowly build up my inventory so that with a wider variety of products I can increase my profits and help pay for kindergarden and primary school for my children.  </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>8129</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To buy thread, cotton, needles, pencils, measuring tape, fabric and wool for my pillow business</use><location><country_code>HN</country_code><country>Honduras</country><town>Tegucigalpa</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>14.1 -87.216667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>5</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-22T17:48:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Bilma Aurora</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-05T22:21:47Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>33.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-22T08:31:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>4844</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-02-23T16:45:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>7959</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-24T04:11:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>11619</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-23T15:42:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13553</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-22T12:58:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17035</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>30</amount><local_amount>30</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>30</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25257</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-22T22:21:47Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-22T09:15:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2823</id><name>Dennis Noe</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>My name is Dennis F. and I work in the transport of people.

With this particular loan she needs to buy a fridge/freezer as the one she has is outgrown the demand for frozen meat in the neighbourhood. She also will put flywire on the house to protect it from mosquitoes. Moataa village is located in a protrected mangrove area on the outskirts of Apia.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Another activity she has is making special mats as the one which is in the photo. Mats are very popular in Samoa. The one pictured here will be used for decoration, not walking on.

with 3 children, Suliveta helps her husband with fishing. They both only have had secondary school education and neither have had a job before. Fishing is their life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The photo shows some of the equipment which is usually purchased by fishing businesses in Samoa. Nets. Goggles, snorkel, flippers, waterproof torch. Fisherman also need a canoe. Samoa is surrounded by a coral reef and the fisherman generally work inside the reef. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Suliveta helps out by selling the fish by the roadside. It is quite common in Samoa to see fish sold this way, hanging off an upright branch. Suliveta occupies the place just by the mangrove swamp on the main road going out of Apia, and if you   drive by that way, you will see her there every afternoon.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Like the other members of her village loan group, she has paid back many loans. These have helped not only with fishing equipment, but also to build a bathroom in the house and pay for childrens school fees.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>8224</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Fishing

His 17-year-old daughter is a handball player. His son is 22, he studies in college to be an IT technician. Sergey’s dream is to open family computer store/club. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Before Sergey started his business, he used to work at a factory adjusting welding equipment. When the factory staff was reduced, Sergey lost his job. He was forced to find another source of income for the family with two little kids. That’s how he ended up at a car repair shop working with a car flattener. In 1994 Sergey decided to start a small business of his own, selling dishware, leather wallets, perfume and souvenirs. The loans he received in “Nadiya Ukraine” helped him reinforce his trade activities, providing necessary resources for his small business. Sergey is very consistent and balanced, he has a good sense of management. That’s why he has succeeded to manage all loans without any delinquencies. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sergey is applying for a loan to get sufficient capital to increase his inventory and gain extra profits. It will not only help him have enough to maintain his family and cover the increasing demand this Christmas season, but also give their family computer business a good start. In the country where most families still don’t have computers at home and many people go to computer clubs to access internet, Sergey and his son can open a client-friendly internet café that would provide high quality service to the community. They are planning to rent a facility, do all the necessary remodelling and purchase desktop computers and supplementary furniture. This computer club will not only provide access to computers, moreover, it will offer any kind of IT services and a wide range of computer equipment for sale.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Сергій – одружений, у нього двоє дітей. 17-річна донька професійно займається гандболом. 22-річний син вивчає в університеті комп’ютерні технології. Мрія Сергія – відкрити власний комп’ютерний магазин/клуб. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Сергій працював на заводі – налагоджував зварювальне устаткування. Коли Сергій втратив роботу, він був змушений шукати інший заробіток, бо треба було якось дбати про родину з двома маленькими дітьми. Так Сергій почав рихтувати автомобілі. В 1994 році Сергій вирішив почати свій бізнес і продавати посуд, гаманці, парфуми та сувеніри. Позики, які він отримав в „Надії України”, допомогли Сергію зміцнити свої позиції на ринку та забезпечити необхідні ресурси для успішного функціонування його бізнесу. Сергій дуже наполегливий та врівноважений. З поміж інших його відрізняє чудове вміння керувати фінансовими ресурсами та часом. Ці якості допомогли йому вчасно виплатити усі позики, отримані в „Надії України”. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Сергій просить про позику для того, щоб отримати необхідні кошти для збільшення кількості товарних одиниць та отримання додаткового прибутку. Це не тільки дасть йому можливість забезпечити родину усім необхідним та задовольнити попит на товари напередодні свят, але й надасть можливість нарешті почати свій сімейний комп’ютерний бізнес. В країні, де велика кількість родин досі не мають власного комп’ютера вдома і багато хто відвідує комп’ютерні клуби для того, щоб скористатися Інтернетом, Сергій та його син хочуть відкрити затишне інтернет-кафе, яке зможе запропонувати спільноті високоякісні комп’ютерні послуги. Сергій з сином планують орендувати приміщення, зробити ремонт, закупити комп’ютери ті необхідні меблі. Слід додати, що в планах Сергія зробити з цього інтернет-клубу також сервіс-центр та магазин, який надає різноманітні послуги у галузі інформаційних технологій, а також займається продажем комп’ютерів та іншого обладнання.

Adalat is a refugee from the occupied Jabrayil region of Azerbaijan who lives in a worker\\\&apos;s hostel in Sumqayit city. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2000 he decided to try his hands in small-scale business and started selling greenery right in front of his hostel. Thus he launched greenery sale business.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this small business and only $200 in working capital, he could hardly meet his family\\\&apos;s needs. To this end in 2004 Adalat borrowed $500 from Norwegian Microcredit. Due to this opportunity he opened vegetable counter in the central market of Sumgayit city, expanded his business and thus considerably improved his welfare. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today when his business is a success, this refugee-turned-entrepreneur intends to open a fruit section of his counter, increase his incomes and finally build his own house. Therefore he applies for the loan of $800. In his belief this will enable him to meet his family’s needs better and make his dream for own house a reality.   He looks ahead with hope and thinks he’s in good capacity to repay the loan.

customers questions and quoting prices is also key and requires a quick and lively salesperson.Mariana is certainly that and has the experience and reputation gained from selling at the Calarasi outdoor market for 7 years now.She and her family also have a small store in her hometown of Horodiste, but most of the time she spends in the busier regional center, sometimes bringing her son along with her.She already carries many goods, but Marianna would like to purchase and sell some new products, including more tea and coffee as well as quickly prepared dried mixes and she needs a loan to

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>When Moldova regained its independence one of the first things to appear were outdoor markets (piatas), springing up in nearly every village and certainly in every larger town. Gheorgita began working at the Calarasi market in 1992 and has done so ever since, working with other vendors and on her own. In an environment where finding any job can be tough, the market can provide steady work, especially important for a mother of two. She was working at the Lottery booth near the entrance when she noticed the unused space next to it and decided to try opening her own business. Now she can be found at her table every day from early in the morning until mid-afternoon, selling a range of clothing and household goods. Her most popular items are head scarves (worn by most Moldovan women) and shirts. When asked how she decides which types of products to stock, Gheorghita says she always tries to keep track of and act on customer inquiries and demands. The most recent thing she has noticed is that many women are asking why she doesn’t have aprons. She would like to take a loan to purchase a supply of aprons and begin offering them at her table.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Petru has always loved bees, ever more so since he began his apiculture business. In the small village of Sadova he works hard to care for his bees and to use their precious production as efficiently and creatively as possible. A Peace Corps volunteer originally helped him research and set up the foundation of his project several years ago and Petru has not stopped learning and experimenting since. Right now, for example, he is working on a new system for the wooden frame that holds the beeswax foundation inside the hive. Currently his operation has two branches: honey production and candle making. The former involves much attention to the health of his bees. In the spring and summer he takes his hives to the forest above his town to allow the bees to find nourishment from different varieties of trees as they come into season, thus creating differentiated honeys as derived from certain blossoms (separated according to the time period in which the bees were feeding). The honey is sold at the local markets as well as in stores, but it is difficult in Moldova to have a good and steady income from honey sales alone so Petru realized that diversification was important. The candle making side of the business entails many steps, starting with finding a steady supply of good wax. Petru wants to generate more of his own high-quality wax since the stock he recently purchased was in large part impure and brittle, but doing so will take some time and require expansion; he would like to work up to a larger scale, hopefully with around 100 families of bees. He works with his family, especially with his daughter who loves painting the finished candles with special paints to make them even more ornate, and sells the candles at stores specializing in crafts and decorative goods. Many local churches also buy tall alter candles from Petru since they know that he only uses high quality wicks and that the candles will burn well. Petru would now like to purchase more hives, to buy a stock of sugar-derived nutrition for wintertime feeding and to buy a supply of finer wax to ensure superior candles for his customers to use in the holiday season.

Sok Por is a 37 year old wife and mother. She has five children, two daughters and three sons. One of her daughters and two of her sons currently attend school, and the youngest daughter and son stay at home. H. Sok Por\&apos;s mother also lives in their home with them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;H. Sok Por sells groceries, and earns about $2.50 a day. Her husband is a cook in a foreign owned restaurant and he earns a salary of $180 per month. When he is not working at the restaurant he works as a motorbike taxi driver. He normally earns about $5 a day from this. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;H. Sok Por is requesting a loan of $900 to change her husband\&apos;s motorbike into a tuk tuk. A tuk tuk is a motorbike that is attached to a passenger cart, which then serves as a taxi. This will allow him to transport more people at one time, which should allow him to increase his income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is H. Sok Por\&apos;s second loan with CREDIT and she had no problem repaying on her last loan. In the future she would like to start a business making wine and raising pigs. Eventually, she and her husband would also like to open their own restaurant. She is excited about being able to increase their income through changing the motorbike into a tuk tuk, and she wants to raise their standard of living enough that she could send her children to university when they are old enough.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>8408</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

His father is retired, his mother is a housewife. His younger sister is a college student. Anton is the sole breadwinner in the family. Anton is also a college student and he pays his college fees himself. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anton is honest and hard-working. He is very creative and full of new ideas. When Anton was working in the sphere of furniture production and assembly, he was dreaming about starting his own business in this industry. However, he didn’t have sufficient capital and he realized he had to provide for his family and cover household expenses. That is why he opened a kiosk selling bakery items. Previous loans in “Nadiya Ukraine” have helped him to buy plastic windows and a door, do all the reconstruction work inside the kiosk, and invest in the inventory.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anton is requesting the above amount to reconstruct his kiosk into a little store and build up a stock of provisions. This loan would give him a chance to buy a larger assortment of goods, such as sugar, flour, vegetable oil, and cereals, which sell extremely well in winter. Anton is also planning to hire a second salesperson providing a stable source of income for one more family in the community. He believes the loan would boost his economic activitity and help him generate more profits. It will not only help him grow his business but also give his family a better quality of life. Anton’s dream is to open a small furniture production factory. He believes financial assistance in combination with his zeal, perserverance and diligent work will someday help his dream come true.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антон – неодружений, живе з батьками та молодшою сестрою. Його батько – пенсіонер, мати – домогосподарка. Молодша сестра навчається в університеті. Антон – єдиний, хто працює в родині. Антон також навчається в університеті та самостійно платить за навчання. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антон – чесна та працьовита людина. Він дуже творчий, в нього повно нових ідей. Коли Антон працював на заводі з виготовлення меблів, він мріяв про свій власний бізнес у цій галузі. Однак в нього не вистачало коштів. Антон розумів, що йому треба дбати про родину та сплачувати рахунки. Тому він відкрив невеличкий кіоск та почав торгувати хлібо-булочними виробами. Позики в „Надії України” допомогли йому придбати пластикові вікна та двері, відремонтувати кіоск та придбати товари.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Антон просить про позику для того, щоб реконструювати кіоск в маленький магазин та розширити асортимент продуктових товарів. Ця позика надасть йому можливість придбати різноманітні продовольчі товари, наприклад: цукор, борошно, олію та крупи, які користуються особливим попитом взимку. Антон також планує взяти на роботу ще одного реалізатора, а отже, забезпечити стабільний заробіток для ще однієї людини. Він вважає, що позика сприятиме розвитку його торгівлі та надасть йому можливість отримати гарний прибуток. Це не тільки допоможе його бізнесу, але й якісно покращить життя його родини. Антон мріє про власний маленький завод з виготовлення меблів. Він вірить, що одного дня за допомогою фінансової підтримки у поєднанні з його наполегливістю, ретельною та старанною працею він досягне цього та зможе втілити свою мрію в життя. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>8425</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To get an assortment of provisions for sale and reconstruct a kiosk into a little store</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-22T00:55:23Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Anton</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-05T20:13:22Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-05T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-05T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-25T08:37:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5140</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:42:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>8960</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-25T09:25:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13680</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>332</amount><local_amount>332</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>332</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>25924</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-22T20:13:22Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-25T09:16:54Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>2919</id><name>Roza</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosa is 40 years old.

runs her own business since 1996. She started up her business with selling medication. With this small retail business and only $300 in working capital she could hardly earn enough money to support her family. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In 2003 she opened her own pharmacy. She increased her capital within a very little time.

Ilgar and his family are homeless and stay in a worker\\\&apos;s hostel in Sumqayit city. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To make the ends meet in 1998 Ilqar got involved in small business. It has been already 8 years since  he has been working as a barber. The earnings he received helped him to repair his house and enabled him to cover somehow the needs of his family in food, clothing and healthcare.   &#13;&#10;   &#13;&#10;Now he needs to borrow $500 loan to buy scissors, razors, powders, mirrors, combs, shampoos and to make some changes in his working place. He hopes this will bring him more incomes and thus will improve the living conditions of his family. He is sure that his good business skills will be very helpful to his in repaying the loan back.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>8812</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Barber

She has a son and a daughter. She is a Technical school graduate. After the studies Nelya lacked work opportunities in her field since there was a problem with unemployment in Ukraine. She had to to sell homemade pastry at the markets to meet the needs of her family. In 2001 she got her first loan in Nadiya Ukraine and decided to start a small business selling coats and jackets. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nelya opened a kiosk at one of the local markets. She employed a lady who is currently working there selling clothing which provides a stable source of income for her family. Nelya also owns a kiosk and rents a store offering a great variety of food products at two different parts of the city.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nelya is very organized and full of energy. She always seeks to provide better service to her customers. She is very responsible and has been punctual with her past loans from Nadiya giving us confidence that she will repay this loan on time.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nelya needs $2,000 to improve her business and stock more clothing items. The loan will help her expand her business and clientele. Applying this additional capital to her business will have a positive impact not only on her trade profitability but will improve the economic and social situation of her employees and their families. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Товстоног Неля Іванівна – одружена. В неї є син і дочка. Неля Іванівна має середньо-технічну освіту. Закінчивши навчання, Неля Іванівна не могла влаштуватися на роботу за своєю спеціальністю, в країні на той час панувало безробіття. Вона була змушена продавати пиріжки на ринках міста для того, щоб задовольнити фінансові потреби родини. В 2001 році Неля Іванівна отримала першу позику в „Надії України” та відкрила власну справу, почавши продавати теплий зимній одяг, а саме, пальта та шуби.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Неля Іванівна відкрила кіоск на одному з місцевих ринків. Вона взяла на роботу жінку, яка зараз працює реалізатором одягу, а отже, отримує стабільну зарплатню та забезпечує свою родину. Неля Іванівна є власницею продуктового кіоску, а також орендує приміщення для того, щоб продавати різноманітні продовольчі товари в іншій частині міста.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Неля Іванівна – дуже організована, завжди сповнена енергії. Вона завжди намагається якомога краще обслуговувати своїх покупців. Вона – відповідальна, завжди дуже пунктуальна, особливо якщо це стосується сплати позик, які вона отримала в „Надії України”. Ці якості підтверджують, що вона спроможна сплатити позику вчасно.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Неля Іванівна просить про суму в 2000 доларів для того, щоб покращити торгівлю та закупити більше одягу задля продажу. Позика сприятиме розвитку бізнесу та допоможе привабити більшу кількість клієнтів. Додатковий капітал позитивно впливатиме не тільки на прибутки з продажу товарів, але й підвищить економічне та соціальне становище її підлеглих та їхніх родин&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2000</funded_amount><paid_amount>2000</paid_amount><image><id>8834</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

house.  She has 15 years of experience selling fast food but had to stop workng when her kids were young.  She started up again six months ago, buying the cart for $100.  Sandra would like to use a loan to buy  chairs and tables to put around her cart, as well as more sodas to sell.  With the extra earnings she hopes this will generate she wants to be able to expand and sell rice and beans as well.  Sandra is 43 years old and lives with her husband and four children.  She works from 5am to 10pm Thursdays through Sundays, with help from her two daughters. Her husband also has a cart, from which he sells morocho, a type of rice pudding.

His main customers are the school children that attend the primary school directly across the road from his store. They mainly buy sweets, packaged snack food and locally made biscuits. Pili also relies on the custom of local villagers who come to buy preserved milk, canned fish, sugar, oil coffee and cigarettes.    &#13;&#10;With his last loan , Pili bought more stock for his store. He broadened the range a little on small items but used most of the proceeds to increase his stock size.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pili’s family consists of 5 adults and 3 children. His brother is the only other family member to regularly contribute to the family’s income. The family’s quality of life has improved with each loan. Benefits are demonstrated in coverage of the children’s school uniforms and fees, more regular staple foods and the construction of a new inside bathroom.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pili is the leader of his

She completed her secondary school in Pago Pago. Prior to joining SPBD she worked as a plantation worker.&#13;&#10;Her business is fishing which she does with her husband. He catches the fish and she sells them and manages the money. Fish are caught every day and usually she will sell to around 20 customers. The fish are sold by the road in her village. This is quite common in Samoa. The photo shows her standing at her road side stall with the fish hanging. In her hand is a swatter to keep the flies off the fish.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tuilagiula is the secretary of her village lending group. This is an unpaid role where her job is to keep a record of all the payments and to facilitate the weekly payments. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She has paid back five loans now with no penalties which places her in the top group of SPBD members and is a testament to her commitment and organisation.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1250</funded_amount><paid_amount>1250</paid_amount><image><id>8954</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Fishing

Since the start of her marriage, she helped her husband in his hardware business. Very dynamic and intelligent, she discovered how to identify what things are in demand in the village of her birth.  So, using an initial loan of $550, which she has since repaid without difficulty, she opened a little hardware supplies store she calls My Victory, a name inspired by her given name.  With the experience derived from her husband and his business, she manages her enterprise pretty well demonstrating a complete mastery of it.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To grow the business and bring in more income, Mrs. K. is requesting a loan of $1,000 which will serve to acquire hardware supplies for resale.

He is married and the father of three children.  Having a good business sense, he realized there is a terrible dearth of feed in the area.  And so he has an idea that would further his livestock business.  But his new business venture requires substantial capital that he does not have.  He has however an excellent credit history with a previous $550 loan that he repaid without a problem.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given the ever-increasing demands that he has not been able to meet, Mr. K. is requesting a loan of $1,200 to stockpile enough feed in case of shortages.  The success of his plan will expand his business and increase his income considerably.  He could then better support his family.  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Né en 1960 Anfoin-Kpodji, Monsieur K. Agossou est éleveur de bétails. Il est marié et père de trois (03) enfants. Il a le sens des affaires et  a pu déceler le manque cruel de provende dans la région et en fait un projet complémentaire à son élevage. Or, cette nouvelle activité nécessite un fonds de roulement consistant qu’il ne dispose pas. Aussi, a-t-il obtenu un crédit de $550 qu’il avait su bien géré et régulièrement remboursé sans incident. Vu les demandes sans cesse croissantes qu’il n’arrive pas à satisfaire, Monsieur K. Agossou sollicite un crédit de $1200 pour acheter des provendes et avoir un stock de sécurité. La réalisation de ce projet va accroître ses activités et augmenter considérablement ses revenus. Ce qui lui permettra de mieux entretenir sa famille.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>9051</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farm

She is married and the mother of five children.  She also has three other dependents, children from her deceased brother.  To help meet the needs of her household, she leaned the handicraft of making colorful waist cloths and has made a professional business out of it.  This handicraft is a growth opportunity requiring a good deal of financing.  Lacking this, Mrs. M. cannot produce her goods in high volume, while her waist cloths are in demand by the inhabitants of her area.  An inventive woman, she puts all of her know-how into her work resulting in goods of exceptional quality.  Thanks to her keen management sense, she was able to repay all the loans she has gotten.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, Mrs. M. is requesting a new loan of $850 as capital to acquire materials for increasing her production of colorful waist cloths.  Uninterrupted production will provide her with substantial income for improving the living conditions of her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame M. Kozé Kalé est née le 24 décembre 1970. Mariée et mère de cinq (05) enfants, elle prend également en charge trois (03) enfants de son frère décédé. Afin de contribuer aux charges du ménage, elle apprit la fabrication artisanale des pagnes teintés et en fait une activité professionnelle. C’est un secteur porteur qui demande assez de financement. Ce qui fait que Madame M. n’a pas la capacité de faire une grande production alors que ses pagnes intéressent beaucoup les habitants de sa localité. Femme ingénieuse, elle met tout son savoir-faire au service de ce travail, ce qui confère à la production une qualité exceptionnelle. Grâce à son sens aigu de gestion, elle a su rembourser tous les crédits qu’elle a obtenus.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ajourd’hui, Madame M. sollicite un nouveau crédit de $850 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat des matériels de fabrication des pagnes teintés. Une production permanente permettra à Madame M. de disposer d’un revenu consistant en vue de l’amélioration des conditions de vie de sa

Born in Zafi in 1954, he has known enough hardship during his education because his parents were poor.  After finishing his studies, he decided to start his own business devoting himself to raising goats and sheep.  Mr. A. applied his training, and his business flourished rapidly, allowing him to support his family.  He had obtained an initial loan of $400, which he repaid without a problem.  These days, he realizes even more that raising goats and sheep is very profitable and a growth area.  That is why he would like to increase his livestock holdings.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Both experienced and talented, Mr. A. has the ability to take care of large herds.  He is however limited by his financial means.  So he is requesting a loan of $950.  This financing would go towards enlarging the corral, acquiring new animals, and buying feed and veterinary supplies on a regular basis.  Such a proposed plan deserves support because it would allow him to avoid being unemployed, something that a majority of young people today are experiencing in Togo.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monsieur A. Koffi Agbégnigan est vétérinaire de formation. Né à Zafi en 1954, il a connu assez de difficultés pendant sa formation à cause de la pauvreté de ses parents.Après la formation, il décide de créer son propre emploi en s’adonnant au petit élevage de caprins et ovins. Grâce au savoir faire de Monsieur A., son élevage devient rapidement florissant. Ce qui lui permet de subvenir aux besoins de la famille. Il a obtenu un premier crédit de $400 qu’il a remboursé sans incident. Aujourd’hui, il se rend compte davantage que l’élevage de caprins de d’ovins est un secteur très rentable et porteur. D’où son désir d’agrandir le cheptel. Expérimenté et doué, il a la capacité de prendre soin d’un troupeau important. Seulement, il est limité par les moyens financiers. Voilà qui l’amène à sollicité ce crédit d‘un montant de $950. Le financement va servir à élargir la clôture, à acheter de nouveaux animaux et acheter régulièrement des produits pour leur traitement. Un tel projet mérite d’être soutenu car il permet à Monsieur A. d’éviter le chômage que la majorité des jeunes connaissent au Togo aujourd’hui.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>9060</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Livestock</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Enlarge

Although a printer by training, he does not practice his trade since he lacked the means to get established.  He then started to help a friend selling lumber for construction and carpentry.  He discovered it to be a very profitable business and decided to start his own enterprise.  He obtained an initial loan of $400 and started selling lumber.  A very energetic man with an eye for quality, he only offers good lumber to his customers thus creating a good reputation for himself locally. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, cabinet-makers and carpenters in the Kpémé area prefer what Mr. K. provides, by far.  Consequently, there is an ever-growing demand that he has not be able to meet.  He would therefore like to grow his business and sell to his customers anytime they have a need.  To do this, he is requesting a loan of $1,200 to order, transport, stock, and sell lumber in Kpémé.  This initiative is deserving of support and encouragement.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Monsieur K. Koffi Folly est né le 28 Septembre 1965 à Aného. Imprimeur de formation, il n’exerce pas le métier car il n’a pas les moyens pour s’installer. Il commença alors à aider un ami dans la vente du bois d’ameublement et de charpente. Il découvre que c’est une activité très rentable et décide de l’entreprendre pour son propre compte. Il obtient un premier crédit d’un montant de $400 et commença à vendre du bois. Très dynamique et ayant le goût de la qualité, il n’offre que du bon bois à sa clientèle et s’est fait une bonne réputation dans la localité. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aujourd’hui, les menuisiers et charpentiers de Kpémé et de ses environs préfèrent de loin les services de Monsieur K. Koffi Folly. Du coup, il a une demande de plus en plus forte qu’il n’arrive pas à satisfaire. Il veut donc agrandir son activité et vendre du bois à tout moment à ses clients. Pour ce faire, il sollicite un crédit de $1200 pour la commande du bois, le transport, le stockage et la revente à Kpémé. Cette initiative mérite d’être soutenue et encouragée.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>9064</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Carpentry</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Buying

Avec cette forte clientèle, elle n’arrive pas à satisfaire à toutes les demandes car son fonds de commerce n’est pas considérable. Ce qui a des impacts sur son ménage. Elle recherche à ce jour un appui financier plus consistant pour agrandir son commerce.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Amah sollicite pour ce faire un crédit d’un montant de $900 qui va servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la revente des bijoux. Financer ce projet aujourd’hui, c’est contribuer au bien-être de la famille de Madame A.

Her husband is a tailor. This dynamic woman always has ambition to participate and take responsibilities for housekeeping, and has done this since an early age. With limited financial means at her disposal, she started a side business of selling loincloth. Today with almost 10 years in the field, she has mastered the contours of the business. She desires to improve this business, and open a shop. But her limited financial means do not permit her to undertake this project, while at the same time the demands of her clients have grown. The level of her schooling is enables her to manager her activities well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today Madame Sylvie G. requests a loan of $950 to improve her business. This loan will permit her to rent a shop and provide a more consistent service, also to purchase and resell loincloth of quality.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from French by Farron Blanc, a Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 37 ans environ, Madame G. Sylvie est mariée et mère de deux (02) enfants. Son mari est un tailleur. Cette femme dynamique a toujours eu pour ambition de participer activement aux charges de son ménage et elle commencé très tôt à se battre pour cela. Avec les maigres moyens qu’elle avait à sa disposition, elle commença un petit commerce de vente de pagne. Aujourd’hui, forte d’une expérience de près de 10 ans dans le domaine, elle maîtrise bien les contours de son activité. Elle désire améliorer cette activité par l’ouverture d’une boutique.  Mais ses moyens financiers très limités ne lui permettent pas d’entreprendre ce projet alors même que la clientèle est devenue importante. Son niveau d’étude secondaire lui permet de bien gérer ses activités. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aujourd’hui Madame G. Sylvie sollicite un financement de $950 pour renforcer son activité. Ce crédit lui permettra de louer une boutique et de disposer d’un fons de commerce plus consistant pour l’achat et la revente des pagnes de qualité.

Married and mother of three children, she is an apprentice dressmaker. The trade has become very competitive, because of the high number of the dressmakers, everyone does not succeed in gaining income from it. Thus, Mrs. A. passes the weeks without being visited by the slightest customer. The living conditions became very difficult in the family because her husband, an apprentice driver is without employment and thus unable to provide for the needs for the children. Conscious of the situation and after doing some market research in her village , Mrs A., decided to launch into the sale of  cement to have a securer source of income. But her means are very limited, she is obliged to supply the retailers, which is not at all profitable. In spite of her passion and her good faith, she is limited in her activities. She then decides to request a financial support to widen her cement trade. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs A. requests a credit of $1000 which will be used by her for the purchase of cement and the hiring of a shop. The improvement of her trade will have certainly a positive impact on the life of her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from French by Farron Blanc, a Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Thérèse est née le 23 Février 1960 à Lomé. Mariée et mère de trois (03) enfants, elle est couturière de formation. Le métier de couture étant devenu très compétitif, à cause du nombre élevé des couturiers, tout le monde n’arrive pas à en tirer un revenu. Ainsi, Mme A. passe des semaines sans être visité par le moindre client. Du coup, les conditions de vie sont devenues très difficiles  dans la famille car le mari, chauffeur de formation est sans emploi et donc incapable de subvenir aux besoins des enfants. Consciente de la situation et après une étude de marché dans sa localité,   Madame A.,  décide de se lancer dans la vente de ciment pour avoir une source de revenu plus sûre. Mais ses moyens étant très limités,  elle est obligée de s’approvisionner chez les revendeurs,  ce qui n’est pas du tout rentable. Malgré son ardeur et sa bonne foi, elle est limitée dans ses activités. Elle décide alors de solliciter un appui financier pour élargir son commerce de ciment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. sollicite un crédit de $1000 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat du ciment depuis l’usine et la location d’une boutique. L’amélioration de son commerce aura certainement un impact positif sur la vie de sa famille.

Fishing is the main activity in the village. Some of Aiga\&apos;s sons fish for crabs in the mangrove. Usually they can make between USD 20 to USD 35 per day and they will catch about 20 to 30 crabs in a week.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aiga is pictured in front of her house, with some of her children in the background. The house has no walls which is traditional in Samoa. It is elevated with a timber floor. She has accumulated alot of fill which is out of shot. With her next loan she will use this and cement to build a cement floor for the house. Over time (several years) the house will be further improved - walls, roofing, kitchen etc. It needs to be high because Sogi is low lying and prone to flooding in the wet season. Also high tides can also cause flooding.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aiga is the secretary of her village lending group which has 18

She is married and the mother of two children.  Since she was little, she learrned how to sell generic medications from her aunt, who had adopted her.  Right after marriage, Mrs. A. started her own business.  And thanks to it, she manages to help her husband meet the needs of the family.  These days, most people do not have enough money to buy things in pharmacies.  They prefer generics, which cost a lot less.  And so, her customer base has become very large, but her limited financial means do not allow her to stock enough items to satisfy the demand. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. A. would like to open a mini-pharmacy, where she can display and sell generics.  To do this, she is requesting a loan of $850 to lease a place for this business venture and to have the  capital to acquire and sell generics.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Angèle est née à Kouvé en 1963. Elle est Mariée et mère de deux (02) enfants. Ayant appris dès son jeune à vendre des produits génériques chez sa tante qui l’a adoptée, elle entrepris cette activité pour son propre compte juste après son mariage. C’est grâce à ce petit commerce qu’elle arrive à aider son mari dans la satisfaction des besoins de la famille. Aujourd’hui, la majorité des habitants n’ont pas les moyens d’acheter les produits en pharmacie et préfèrent les produits les génériques qui coûtent beaucoup moins chers. Du coup, la clientèle de Madame A. est devenue très importante mais  ses moyens financiers limités ne lui permettent pas d’avoir un grand étalage et satisfaire tous ses clients&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. désire aujourd’hui ouvrir une mini pharmacie où elle va étaler et vendre les produits génériques. Pour cela, elle sollicite un crédit de $850 qui va servir à louer un local pour la pharmacie et disposer de fonds de commerce l’achat et la revente des produits génériques.

The little shoe business that Mrs. A. runs is what, to a large extent, covers the needs of the family.  To support her family completely, she is in need of more substantial income.  That is why she has an ardent desire to expand her shoe business.  Yet she does not have enough money to do so.  Very energetic and driven by a keen business sense, she possesses just what it takes to realize her plans.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. A. is currently requesting a loan of $850 to lease a boutique and to have the capital to acquire shoes in bulk and at a lower cost.  She would thus have substantial income in order to improve the living conditions of her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Edoh est née le 08 Décembre 1972 à Lomé. Issue d’une famille nombreuse, elle a dû abandonner les études par manque de moyens pour se lancer dans le commerce des chaussures. Aujourd’hui mariée et mère d’un (01) enfant, elle continue de vivre une situation difficile car le revenu familial est très insuffisant.  Son mari qui est un comptable est en chômage depuis longtemps et c’est le petit commerce de la femme qui couvre en grande partie les besoins de la famille. Pour supporter totalement ces charges, elle a besoin d’un revenu plus consistant d’où son ardent désir d’élargir son commerce de chaussures. Seulement, elle n’a pas assez de moyens pour le faire. Très dynamique  et animé d’un sens aigu de gestion, elle a assez d’atouts pour mener à bien son projet. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mme A. sollicite à ce jour un crédit de $850 qui va lui servir à louer une boutique et disposer de fonds de commerce pour l’achat des chaussures en gros et à moindre coût. Ainsi elle disposera de revenu consistant en vue d’améliorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>9170</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe

She is in business selling bath soap (Lagossidi).  This soap is made in Nigeria and Ghana, and everybody appreciates this fact, since the soap is good for the skin and inexpensive too.  Her husband, a substitute teacher in a local private school, has not been able to provide for the family given his meager and sporadic salary.  So, over 75% of household expenses is resting on Josiane herself.  Using an initial loan of $400, which was repaid regularly, she managed to grow her business a little.  To do more would require more substantial funding. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. G., lacking the funds, must get her stock of soap from retailers who ultimately leave her with only a small profit margin.  So, she is requesting financial support in the amount of $950 as capital to create a significant inventory of soap and to act as a wholesaler.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 50 ans environ, Madame G.

C’est un savon fabriqué au Nigeria et au Ghana que tout le monde apprécie car c’est très bon pour la peau et économique. Son mari, un enseignant vacataire dans une école privée de la place, n’arrive pas à subvenir aux besoins de la famille avec son maigre salaire et encore très irrégulier. Ainsi, plus de 75% des charges du foyer reposent-t-elles sur la femme. Avec un premier crédit de $400 obtenu et régulièrement remboursé, Josiane est arrivée à augmenter légèrement ses activités qui nécessitent aujourd’hui un financement assez consistant. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;N’ayant pas de moyens, Madame G. Josiane s’approvisionne chez les revendeurs ce qui lui laisse pas une marge bénéficiaire conséquente. Aussi, sollicite-t-elle un appui financier de $950 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour faire un stock consistant de savon et agir comme une grossiste.

She is married and the mother of two children.  A very energetic woman, she started very early on, working in the yams business in her neighborhood.  She currently is established at the grand market of Hédrzanawoé in Lomé.  But she lacks enough funds to stock yams in quantity.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her business is successful, and given the bigger and bigger demand, she needs more funding in order to satisfy the market.  To do this, she is requesting a loan of $750 which will allow her to go herself to order yams from the source, to transport them to Lomé, to keep an inventory, and to sell them at the grand market.  Her plans will certainly improve her level of income.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame K. Elise est née en 1975 à Tsévié dans la préfecture de Zio. Elle est mariée et mère de deux (02) enfants. Très dynamique, elle a très tôt entrepris le commerce des ignames dans son quartier. Actuellement elle a trouvé une place au grand marché de Hédrzanawoé à Lomé pour s’installer mais elle n’a pas assez de moyens pour faire un approvisionnement quantitatif d’ignames.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Vu le succès qu’elle réalise dans ses activités et les demandes de plus en plus importantes, elle a besoin de plus de moyens financiers afin de pouvoir répondre aux exigences du marché. Elle sollicite pour cela un crédit de $750 qui va lui permettre d’aller elle-même faire la commande d’ignames dans les zones de production, le transporter à Lomé, le stocker et le revendre au grand marché. Ce projet améliorera  à coup sûr le revenu de Mme K.

Nearly all household expenses rest on the shoulders of Mrs. K..  Five years ago, she began her business selling tomatoes using the paltry resources she had at the time.

Elle a commencé ses activités de vente de tomate il y a 5 ans avec les moyens dérisoires qu’elle disposait.

She had to quit secondary school because her parents could no longer pay for her education.  She then started selling frozen foods.  Her husband, a retired teacher, has no other income than his meager pension and relies instead on his wife to meet family needs.  Very energetic and honest, Mrs. L. figured out how to repay her past loans with any problem.  &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Seeing that the craze for her frozen food items keeps growing and growing,  Mrs. L. would like to expand her business.

Son mari, un enseignant en retraite n’a plus d’autres revenus en dehors de sa maigre pension et s’appui plutôt sur la femme pour les besoins de la famille. Très dynamique et honnête,  Madame L.

Having left school very early, she was sheltered by her uncle, whose wife has a business selling plastic bags for wrapping and storing.  There, she acquired a good deal of experience in this trade, and she established her own business five years ago.  Unmarried with one dependent, she is managing to deal with her day-to-day problems using her meager income.  Since the bags she sells are regarded as a primary necessity, the demand is constantly strong.  Realizing this, she would like to make her modest business into a professional one.  To do that, she needs substantial funding.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ms. B. is requesting a loan of $850 to increase the size of her business and to clear a substantial enough profit to meet the demands in life that she now faces.  The loan amount requested will go toward leasing a store and keeping a constant inventory in order to meet market demands.  She will name her store «Le Vainqueur»(The Winner).  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame B.

She employs two children as domestic help.  Having retired two years ago, she started a business preparing and selling «tchoukoutou», a local beer made from sorghum.  Her husband is also retired and has no income aside from his pension.  Income is a real problem for the family.  Thanks to this business selling tchoukoutou, the family is arduously managing to make ends meet.  Mrs. S. provides a level of quality that has won her a large customer base.  She realizes that increasing her production will improve her income very much.  For this reason, she is requesting financial support in the amount of $900 as capital to buy and stock sorghum, as well as some firewood, for the purposes of preparing tchoukoutou in sizeable quantities.  Her business is named «Cabaret de la Joie».&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 50 ans environ, Madame S. Abidé est mariée et mère de quatre (04) enfants. Elle emploie deux enfants comme domestique. Admise à la retraite il y a 2 ans, elle s’est lancée dans la préparation et la vente de « Tchoukoutou », une boisson locale préparée à base de sorgho. Son mari aussi admis à la retraite n’a aucun revenu à part sa pension. Il se pose alors un réel problème de revenu pour la famille. Grâce à cette activité de vente de « Tchoukoutou », la famille arrive à s’en sortir péniblement.  La qualité du service qu’elle offre lui  procure une clientèle importante. Mme S. se rend compte que l’augmentation de sa production améliorera pour beaucoup son revenu. C’est pour cela qu’elle sollicite un appui financier d’un montant de $900 qui va servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat et le stockage du sorgho, du bois de chauffe en vue de la préparation en quantité du « tchoukoutchou ».</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>9203</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pub</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

She is married and the mother of three children.  Besides being a dressmaker by trade, she is also active   generating income from selling colorful traditional fabrics.  Her modest income allows her to help meet household expenses.  Her husband, a taxi driver, has become disabled following a traffic accident and no longer has an income.  He looks after one dependent for his wife.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As the head of household now, Mrs. A. is overwhelmed by expenses at home and is at the end of her wits.  She is desperately seeking a way out.  So she is requesting a loan of $950 to revitalize her business, named Couture La Grâce, and to augment the income she needs to provide for her family.  The loan amount requested will be the financial capital needed for stocking and selling waist cloths.  Financing her plan will rescue her entire family.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Lébéné est née en 1961 à Lomé. Elle est mariée et mère de trois (03) enfants. En dehors de son métier de couture, elle exerce une autre activité génératrice de revenu qui est le commerce des pagnes. Son petit revenu lui permet de contribuer aux charges du ménage. Son mari, un chauffeur de taxi, est devenu handicapé après un accident de circulation et n’a plus de revenu. Il est devenu une charge pour sa femme. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Devenue « chef de famille », Madame A. est écrasée par les charges du ménage et ne sait plus à quel sain se vouer. Elle recherche désespérément un moyen pour s’en sortir. Elle sollicite alors un crédit de $950 pour rehausser le niveau de son activité et avoir plus de revenu pour subvenir à sa famille. Le montant sollicité va servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la revente des pagnes. Financer ce projet, c’est sauver toute une famille.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>9204</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Textiles</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Buying

She had to quit school early on, so that she could train as a cook.  For two years, she has been actively looking for a way to get established and to put her high-potential cooking skills into practice.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a loan of $950, Miss A. would better equip herself for broader benefit.  Her strategy will consist of going public to provide less expensive  hotel-style meals featuring both European and African cuisine.  Her availability will be an asset for preparing special order meals and preferred dishes, as well as for the catering of celebrations, funerals, and other gatherings.  And the energy and ingenuity of this young girl are just what is needed for the success of her plans.  She will name her business «Restaurant Joy».&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mademoiselle A. Hodo est une fille orpheline et aînée d’une famille de douze (12) enfants. Elle dû très tôt abandonner ses études pour apprendre le métier de cuisine. Voici depuis deux ans qu’elle est dans la vie active cherchant un moyen pour s’installer et exercer son activité qui est très porteuse. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Avec une somme d’un montant de $950, elle peut mieux s’équiper pour une meilleure prestation à la population. Sa stratégie consistera à  mettre à portée de la population, des repas d’hôtel à moindre coût ; des mets européens et africains. Sa disponibilité sera un atout pour des services sur commande, repas préférentiel, fêtes, décès et autres manifestations. Le dynamisme et l’habileté de cette jeune fille constituent autant d’atouts pour le succès de son projet.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>9209</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Acquire

Rita</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>At the very earliest age, Jacqueline Rita A. got her business experience from her mother, a merchant.  She learned about buying and selling even while going to school, and so she was able to start her own business selling kids clothing and traditional waist cloths right after dropping out.  Her older sister was already working in this field and helped with her modest display of items for sale.  Business is booming now, but according to customers, the range of choices she offers is limited.   &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. A. has a plan to diversify her range of goods and to include groceries too, which is a very promising growth opportunity for our locale.  She is requesting a loan of $900 as capital for buying and selling clothing and food items.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Jacqueline Rita est une fille de revendeuse. Elle a donc appris dès son plus bas âge à faire le petit commerce même en allant à l’école. L’expérience acquise dans ce domaine lui a permis de se lancer dans le commerce d’habits d’enfants, de pagnes dès l’abandon de ses études. Sa grande sœur qui exerce déjà cette activité l’a aidé à avoir un petit étalage. L’activité se révèle florissante mais la gamme des produits n’est pas variée selon la demande de la clientèle.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elle désire a travers ce projet, diversifier la gamme des produits et associer en même temps la commercialisation des produits alimentaires et congelés, activité très porteuse et fructueuse dans nos milieux. Elle sollicite un crédit de $900 qui va lui permettre de disposer d’un fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la revente des habits et des produits alimentaires.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Abandoned by her polygamous husband, Edwige K. had to take on the responsibility for educating her children very early on.  Thank goodness they are in good health!   Still, the expense of schooling is becoming more and more  costly.  And to deal with the situation, it is critical that she grow her business.  The name of her business is «La Princesse», where she will sell clothing for children, shirts for men, and some grocery items.  The clothing she offers is highly appreciated in certain areas and is furthermore preferred by a select clientele.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her business is in a growth sector.  However, lacking substantial capital, Mrs. K. has not been able to benefit fully from the fruit of her labor, most recently during a period of high demand.  She would like to expand her range of goods for sale and to provide for her children in a more proper manner.  To do this, she is requesting a loan of $950 to lease a store and then acquire and sell clothes and food items.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abandonnée par un mari polygame, Madame K. Edwige a dû très tôt prendre en charge l’éducation de ses enfants. Dieu merci ! Ils sont en bonne santé. Cependant les charges scolaires deviennent de plus en plus pesantes et pour faire face à cette situation, il lui est indispensable d’étendre son activité. Elle est revendeuse de vêtements d’enfants, des chemises d’hommes et un peu d’alimentation générale. Ces vêtements sont très appréciés dans certains milieux et préférés par une catégorie de personnes. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;C’est une activité très porteuse mais ne disposant pas d’un capital substantiel, Madame K. n’a pu bénéficier pleinement des fruits de son activité ces derniers temps où la demande a été forte. Elle souhaite agrandir  l’éventail de ses articles et de subvenir plus décemment aux besoins de ses enfants. Pour ce faire, elle sollicite un crédit de $950 pour louer un magasin puis acquérir et revendre des vêtements et des produits d’alimentation générale.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>9215</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She currently works part time in an organization but her monthly revenue is very minimal and is not enough to address the needs of her and her two children.  She has therefore decided to open a side business, and was able to obtain a $400 credit in order to partner with her sister in law and open a little general food store.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, she would like to start by buying frozen products since the demand is great in the community.  Her finances being limited, she is soliciting a loan in order to realize her project.  She is asking for a $900 loan in order to buy a freezer and to buy and sell frozen products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 29 ans, Madame A. Ablavi Ahoéfa est célibataire et mère de deux (02) enfants. Elle  travaille actuellement en tant qu’agent temporaire dans une société de la place mais son revenu mensuel est très dérisoire et n’arrive pas à couvrir ses besoins et ceux de ses enfants. Elle décida alors d’associer une activité parallèle. C’est ainsi qu’elle réussit à obtenir un crédit de $400 et s’associe à sa belle sœur pour ouvrir une petite boutique d’alimentation générale. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aujourd’hui, elle veut commencer la vente des produits congelés  dans la boutique car la demande est devenue importante dans la localité. Mais ses moyens financiers étant limités, elle sollicite un appui financier pour réaliser ce projet. Le crédit de $900 qu’elle sollicite va permettre d’acheter un congélateur, et de disposer d’un fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la revente des produits congelés.

She was adopted by her uncle and was taught how to do business by his wife.  Very early on she began an onion business.  Married and a mother of two children, she also takes care of another child from a deceased aunt.  She has been selling onions for the last three years, which allows her to contribute money to support the family.  Her husband is a tailor who does not have enough business as he does not have a studio of his own.  Very dynamic and an entrepreneur, she is a good business woman and has thus far been able to reimburse all of the loans she has received.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At this time she would like to improve her business by buying in bulk quantities from Burkina Faso.  In order to do this she is asking for a credit of $900 which will serve as funds to use when placing the order, stocking and selling the ognions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Née le 19 Janvier 1978 à Kévé dans la préfecture du Zio,Madame K. Akossiwa est issue d’une famille nombreuse et a connu toutes les difficultés. Adoptée par son oncle, elle a appris à faire du commerce avec sa femme. Très tôt elle a su se prendre en charge et s’est lancée dans le commerce des oignons. Mariée et mère de deux (02) enfants, elle a à sa charge un (01) enfant de sa tante décédée. Cela fait 3 ans qu’elle exerce cette activité de vente d’oignon très florissante, ce qui lui permet de contribuer aux charges du ménage. Son mari est un maître tailleur qui n’a pas assez de clientèle car il n’a pas d’atelier. Très dynamique et entreprenante, elle arrive à bien gérer ses activés et a su rembourser tous les  crédits qu’elle a obtenus. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elle souhaite aujourd’hui améliorer son commerce en commandant en gros ses produits depuis le Burkina Faso. Pour cela elle sollicite un crédit de $900 qui va servir de fonds de commerce pour la commande, le stockage et la revente des oignons.

She sells sponges in order to contribute to the cost of their home.  For the last five years her husband has been retired, and she has struggled to feed and education their children.  This is very hard as the needs of the children grow as the children themselves grow up.  The retirement pension they receive is not nearly enough to cover his needs.  Active and courageous, Mrs. B. is hoping to find a place in the big Lomé marketplace in order to enlarge her business.  This requires a bit more money than she has.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Therfore, she is asking for an $850 loan which would allow her to rent a place in the large market area and would give her base money to buy and sell sponges.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Agée de 37 ans environ, Madame B. Rose est mariée et mère de six (06) enfants. Elle exerce comme activité la vente des éponges en filet pour contribuer aux charges de son foyer. Depuis 5 ans que son mari est admis à la retraite, elle se bat pour nourrir et scolariser ses enfants. Ce qui n’est pas facile car les besoins deviennent de plus en plus importants au fur et à mesure que les enfants grandissent. La petite pension de retraite de son mari ne suffit en rien pour ces besoins. Active et courageuse, Madame B. se propose de trouver une place au grand marché de Lomé pour agrandir son commerce. Ce qui demande un peu plus moyens dont elle ne dispose pas.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; Elle sollicite alors  un financement de $850 qui lui permettra de louer une place au grand marcher et disposer d’un fonds de commerce pour l’achat et la revente des éponges en filet&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>9222</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

She stopped her studdied when she reached secondary school due to lack of money and is trying to sell vegetable oil in order to support her needs and those of the two children she takes care of.  Very dynamic and talented at sales she is doing ok, but the money she makes is insufficient and does not last very long.  Therefore, she often buys a product from a small vendor and resells it.  In these instances, revenue is not consistent.  She is hoping for financial resources to improve her business by also selling rice.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today, Ms. Dogan S. is asking for an $850 loan to rent a place for her shop as well as to buy and sell vegetable oil and rice.  This would allow Ms. S. to improve her living conditions as well as those in her care.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mlle S.

Elle a arrêté les études au niveau secondaire faute de moyens et entreprend la vente d’huile végétale pour assurer ses propres besoins et celui des deux enfants qu’elle a à sa charge. Très dynamique et douée en la matière elle arrive à s’en sortir.  Mais dont elle dispose est très insuffisants. Par conséquent, elle va souvent acquérir son produit chez de petits détaillants pour le revendre. Dans ce cas, le revenu n’est pas consistant  et les conditions de vie restent mauvaises.  Elle cherche alors un moyen financier pour améliorer son activité en y associant la vente du riz   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aujourd’hui, Mlle S.

Yawa was born in 1962 in Sokodé. A widow for the last five years with seven children, it has been difficult for her to meet her family responsibilities with the income she earns from selling millet. Her husband was a contract teacher and left her no inheritance; his parents are also unable to help the children. Madame T. Yawa is responsible for all the needs of her family. Millet trade is flourishing because there is a high level of millet consumption in her town, but she doesn’t have the means to meet daily demand. Today her ambition is to stock millet herself from agricultural zones and to resell it in Lomé. This will require a means of finance. It is for this project that Madame T. Yawa is seeking a loan of $850 as capital for the purchase, storage, and resale of millet. To help this widow is to save orphans. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Madame T. Yawa est née en 1962 à Sokodé. Veuve depuis 5 ans et avec ses sept (07 enfants, elle fait face difficilement aux charges de la famille avec le revenu de la vente de mil qu’elle exerce il y a 15. Son mari enseignant vacataire n’a rien laissé comme héritage et ses parents n’arrivent pas à aider les enfants. Madame T. Yawa se trouve dans l’obligation de prendre tous les besoins de la famille en charge. Le commerce du mil est une activité très florissante car le mil est très consommé par les habitants de sa localité. Mais elle n’a pas assez de moyens pour satisfaire toute la demande qui s’offre à elle quotidiennement. Son ambition aujourd’hui est d’aller s’approvisionner elle-même dans les zones productrices du mil et le revendre à Lomé. Ce qui demande un moyen financier plus important. C’est qui amène Madame T. Yawa à solliciter un crédit de $850 qui va servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat, le stockage et la revente du mil. Aider cette veuve c’est sauver les orphelins.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>9228</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>purchase,

Abidé was born in 1960. She is a married mother of six children. To generate income, she sells a local drink called “sodabi,” which is made from palm oil extract. This drink is very popular with the local population. The quality of her work and rigorous management has brought her a satisfactory clientele. Because of the quality of her sodabi, clients buy in bulk for resale. That’s the way Mme S. keeps her business thriving. Currently she can’t meet daily demand, therefore she wants to increase her business and needs a more consistent means of finance. She is seeking a loan of $900 which will serve as capital for the purchase, storage, and resale of sodabi in order to meet her clients’ demand. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Madame S. Abidé est née en 1960. Elle est mariée et mère de six (06) enfants. Elle exerce comme activité génératrice de revenue la vente de la boisson locale « SODABI »,  une boisson  extraite à base du palmier à huile. C’est une boisson appréciée par la population. La qualité de son travail et la gestion rigoureuse qu’elle en fait lui procurent  une clientèle acceptable. A cause de la qualité de sa boisson, des clients viennent s’en procurer en gros pour aller revendre. C’est ainsi qu’on constate une animation permanente chez Mme S.. Actuellement, elle n’arrive plus à satisfaire la demande qui s’offre à elle quotidiennement. Elle veut alors augmenter son activité et a besoin de moyens financiers plus consistants. Elle sollicite un crédit de $900 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour l’achat,  le stockage et la revente du « sodabi » en vue de répondre aux demandes de sa clientèle.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>9229</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft

She has already successfully repaid four loans without difficulty. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today she is asking for $800 which will allow her to put up new, larger ovens and to buy more boxes of fish.

Kuya was born December 31st, 1965 and is the mother of four children. Tireless and very dedicated, she has the sense of a good educator and struggles for her children’s success. She lives in Gapé where she works in pottery and puts her income towards household expenses. This is a successful business activity because in her area large clay pots are used for cooking in the kitchen. With inadequate finance however, she is unable to meet market demand. Today Madame A. seeks a new loan of $750 which will serve as capital to increase her output. She possesses sound morals and deserves support to continue her activities in order to change her living conditions. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Madame A. Kuya est née le 31 Décembre 1965 et mère de quatre (04) enfants. Infatigable et très dévouée, elle a le sens d’une bonne éducatrice et se bat pour la réussite de ses enfants. Elle vit à Gapé où elle exerce comme activité la poterie pour contribuer aux charges du ménage avec les revenus. C’est une activité qui marche bien car dans sa localité les marmites sont utilisé comme ustensiles de cuisine. Avec ses moyens dérisoires, elle n’arrive pas à satisfaire les demandes du marché.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Aujourd’hui Madame A. sollicite un nouveau crédit de $750 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce en vue d’augmenter sa production. Elle jouit d’une bonne moralité et mérite des soutiens pour continuer ses activités en vue d’un changement de ses conditions de vie.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>9234</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home

She has two grown up kids. Her hobby is to take care of her grandchildren. Lyubov is a art school graduate. She is a professional dancing teacher. Lyubov used to give dancing classes for living. However, soon she realized that she lacked opportunities in her field. She borrowed some money and added her personal savings to start her own business. Today she became an entrepreneur running her small kiosk selling toys and games. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lyubov is very generous. She has a kind and caring heart. Her love for children motivated her to choose this sphere of business. Being a sociable person, Lyubov manages to find common language with every client. Every time you pass by her kiosk you can see her talking to a new person who will definitely end up buying something. Lyubov has worked with “Nadiya Ukraine” since 2003. She has repaid 16 loans. She is always telling others about lending services “Nadiya Ukraine” can offer to small business owners.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lyubov needs a loan of $800 to increase on stock for Christmas season (December 25th – January 14th  in Ukraine).  She wants to buy stuffed toys, table games, Barbie dolls, puzzles, construction pieces etc. in bulk from wholesale distributors. Lyubov has worked in this business for over 3 years. She knows exactly what kids will like and how to make a child happy. She doesn’t have to advertise her trade stalls because attractive toy displays and bright colors draw potential clients to her kiosk. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Lyubov will manage the loan efficiently and repay it in time. Financial assistance will not only help Lyubov expand her commercial activity, it will also fill so many homes with joy and happy smiles this Christmas season.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Любов Іванівна – дуже щедра людина. В неї щире та любляче серце. Її любов до дітей підштовхнула її обрати саме цю галузь бізнесу. Любов Іванівна – дуже відкрита людина. Їй вдається знайти спільну мову з будь-яким клієнтом. Кожного разу проходячи повз її кіоск, можна побачити, як вона розмовляє з новим покупцем, який ніколи не піде без покупки. Любов Іванівна працює з „Надією України” з 2003 року. Вона отримала та сплатила 16 позик. Любов Іванівна з радістю розповідає іншим про кредитні послуги, які „Надія України” може запропонувати власникам малого бізнесу.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Любов Іванівна хотіла б отримати позику розміром в 800 доларів для того, щоб збільшити асортимент товарів напередодні свят (в Україні це період з 25-го грудня до 14-го січня).  Вона хотіла б придбати м’які іграшки, настільні ігри, ляльок Барбі, пазли, конструктори тощо за помірними цінами в оптових дистриб’юторів. Любов Іванівна займається цим бізнесом вже понад 3 роки. Вона знає, що до вподоби дітям, що саме може зробити дитину щасливою. Їй не треба робити рекламу своїх товарів, тому що яскраві іграшки, вміло розташовані на вітрині завжди приваблюють потенційних клієнтів. Маючи здібність мудро використовувати свій час та зароблені гроші, Любов Іванівна зможе сплатити позику вчасно. Фінансова підтримка не тільки допоможе їй розширити торгівлю, але й наповнить багато домівок радістю та щасливими посмішками напередодні Новорічних та Різдвяних свят.  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>9373</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To increase on stock for Christmas season</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2006-12-25T18:48:34Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lyubov</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-01-09T22:12:54Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-02-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-03-09T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-04-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-09T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-06-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-01-26T08:32:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5368</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-03-02T02:45:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9039</payment_id><comment>scheduled payment</comment></payment><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-04-26T09:25:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>13923</payment_id><comment>scheduled repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-26T09:17:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17417</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26217</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2006-12-26T22:12:54Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-26T09:17:39Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>3101</id><name>Rosemond</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosemond Ventures is a phone use company in Shama dealing in communication for the clients in the local community with a popualation of 21,000 inhabitants.

Ama Lolonyo is the mother of two children. Worried about her children’s education, she placed them in a boarding school in Tsévié, which is very costly. Her income from trading and selling “Wax Hollandais” fabric is not enough to support her family. Not having finance, even though market demand is high, Madame D. is seeking a new loan of $1200 which will serve as capital to stock fabric to meet her clients’ demand. She has already had four loans in her name, successfully repaid thanks to her sound management. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Agée de 41 ans environs, Madame D. Ama Lolonyo est mère de deux (02) enfants. Soucieuse de l’éducation de ses enfants, elle les a mis à l’internat de Tsévié, ce qui pèse lourdement sur elle. Les revenus de son commerce de vente de pagnes « Wax Hollandais » sont insuffisants pour subvenir à ses besoins. N’ayant plus de moyens alors que la demande est grande sur le marché, Madame D. sollicite un nouveau crédit de $1200 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour s’approvisionner en pagne en vue de répondre à la demande de sa clientèle. Elle a à son actif 4 crédits, tous bien remboursés grâce à sa gestion

Kodjo is a dynamic young man born in Gapé in 1983. He has launched a business selling spare parts along the roadside. He restocks each week in Tsévié. Little by little, his clientele has grown, and he can now no longer finance his business to meet demand. In general, this is a very promising business for him. This is why he is seeking a loan of $1200 to meet the growing demand of his customers. This will allow him to build a consistent supply of parts and to avoid making trips to Tsévié each week. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Monsieur A. Kodjo est un jeune actif et dynamique né en 1983 à Gapé. Pour se prendre en charge, il se lance dans la vente des pièces détachées au bord de la route. Il s’approvisionne toutes les semaines à Tsévié. Petit à petit, il arrive à avoir plus de clientèle qu’il n’arrive pas à satisfaire par manque de moyens financiers. D’une manière générale, cette activité est très prometteuse pour lui. C’est pourquoi, il sollicite un crédit de $1200 pour pouvoir répondre à la demande de plus en plus croissante de sa clientèle. Cela servira à constituer un stock consistant de pièces et l’évitera le trajet Gapé Tsévié qu’il fait toutes les semaines.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>9397</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home
