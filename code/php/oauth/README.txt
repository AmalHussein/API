Welcome the world of OAuth!
---------------------------

You will first need a developer account at Kiva.org. Head over to http://build.kiva.org to register.

When you are registered, you need to add a new application to your dashboard to get a Client ID and Client Secret. Open kiva.php and enter these at the top. Then run kiva.php to see the OAuth magic.
