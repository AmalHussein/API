He has worked the lands of his farm to feed and raise his eight children, some who still work with him. He is very proud of what he has done, especially because he cannot even read or write, yet he has always had a means to support his household. He is requesting a loan because he wants to invest in some feed for his livestock and also in machinery that will help him be more effective when planting rice. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10; </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25965</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Romulo would like to invest in some feed for his livestock and machinery that will help him be more effective in planting his rice</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:40:56Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Romulo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T13:34:24Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T19:20:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24201</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociación montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-20T17:12:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33942</payment_id><comment>2do pago montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:15:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44790</payment_id><comment>3er pago montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T17:28:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71885</payment_id><comment>4TO PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESISTAS</comment></payment><payment><amount>816</amount><local_amount>816</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>816</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107737</payment_id><comment>PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESITAS</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T13:34:24Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T21:16:31Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8118</id><name>Rosenie</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Rosenie started to utilize her skills cooking to support her and her daughter after she was unable to find a job elsewhere.

Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Agustin was born and raised in Baba where he has spent his life working in agriculture. He never had the opportunity to go to school, but through hard work he has been able to send some of his kids to school. Despite his age, he still works the fields and makes his land produce great rice. He hopes with the loan he will be able to be more effective. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10; </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>25970</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Agustin would like to use his loan to make his rice farm more effective</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T15:58:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Agustin</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T14:27:27Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>425</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T19:10:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24193</payment_id><comment>1er pago asoc montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-20T17:11:03Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33940</payment_id><comment>2do pago montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:14:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44789</payment_id><comment>3er pago montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T17:31:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71887</payment_id><comment>4TO PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESISTAS</comment></payment><payment><amount>289</amount><local_amount>289</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>289</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107727</payment_id><comment>PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESISTAS</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T14:27:27Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T20:59:58Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8123</id><name>Florante</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Florante lives in an impoverished rural community outside the city of Trou-du-Nord, Haiti where she travels to sell cooking ingredients from a small stand along the street. Her business is dedicated to financing the economic care of her four children as well as a source of savings to improve their home and living conditions. In order to bring herself closer to her goals of providing adequately for her children, she has requested this loan to expand her inventory to include more basic food staples that are popular items to sell so that she can become more self sustainable. Currently Florante only sells a couple of ingredients that she has managed to turn into a business and has demonstrated that she is ready to take her business further with the opportunity this loan provides for her.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Florante is a member of an Bank of Hope solidarity group, along with nine other entrepreneurs. They will be accountable to one another for paying back this loan of $1,200. This group lending method requires group members to help one another throughout the loan repayment process. Loans are paid back as a group. If one person is deficient on their loan, the group must make up the difference.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Ovidio has been farming rice on his land for 20 years. He and his family of four children all still live on the farm. He works the fields with his sons, one who is pictured, and they all share in the profits. He also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers on his farm. He will be very happy to receive a loan and hopes he can invest in fertilizers and pesticides to nurture his crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Emilio has a farm where he cultivates rice. He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for his entire life working in agriculture. His education is very limited, but he has been able to raise two children through his rice cultivation. He has over 35 years of experience with this crop and he now has the help of his two sons who work with him. He is planning to use the loan to invest in pesticides and fertilizer for his land. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>25980</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T05:58:51Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Emilio</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-05-01T06:46:53Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1075</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T16:54:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23686</payment_id><comment>1er pago banca comunal asoc el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T23:38:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71901</payment_id><comment>2 do pago el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>823</amount><local_amount>823</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T18:20:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>823</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>99062</payment_id><comment>6to pago</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>210205</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-17T06:46:53Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-14T17:02:17Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8130</id><name>Lalotea</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Lalotea is married with children and has joined SPBD’s program in order to help sustain her family.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Ramon has three children who help him on his farm. He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for over 30 years where he has made a living growing rice. Although his children are all grown up, they all work the fields together in order to make ends meet for the family. On his farm Ramon also raises plantain trees and a few other secondary crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Despite Esteban&apos;s age, he still works the lands that were given to him by his father. He is a rice farmer in Baba, Ecuador where he was born and raised. He has had two children, both of whom are grown up and independent. He lives on his farm with his wife and together they make ends meet through rice production. He hopes he can invest the loan by acquiring fertilizers that will help his crops grow better. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>25992</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T15:58:49Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Esteban</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T18:02:50Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1075</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T17:01:38Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23693</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociación el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-17T21:40:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33127</payment_id><comment>2do pago asoc el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>823</amount><local_amount>823</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T18:25:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>823</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>99069</payment_id><comment>6to pago</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>140968</payment_id><comment>PAGO DE EL ANZUELO</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T18:02:50Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-23T17:27:19Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8137</id><name>Toeaso</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>From the Samoan village of Elise Fou, Toeaso operates a restaurant catering drinks and baked goods at the local Savalalo market.

He has only had his farm for several years, but it is serving well to feed his wife and his infant child. He wants to invest the loan received in improving his crop output. He hopes to buy more seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. His long term goal is to improve his home for his growing family. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>25995</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T04:45:01Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Alfredo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-05-01T22:02:33Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1075</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T23:40:01Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:44:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71902</payment_id><comment>1er pago el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>909</amount><local_amount>909</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T18:22:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:44:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>909</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>99064</payment_id><comment>6to pago el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-14T16:44:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:44:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>210200</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-17T22:02:33Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-14T16:44:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8139</id><name>Fausto</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Fausto was born and raised in Baba, Ecuador where he has grown up cultivating rice.

After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>25998</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T05:30:32Z</posted_date><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Fausto</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T19:55:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>550</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T16:56:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23688</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociación el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-17T21:37:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33122</payment_id><comment>2do pago asoc el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T23:42:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71904</payment_id><comment>3 er pago el anzuelo</comment></payment><payment><amount>378</amount><local_amount>378</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T18:23:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>378</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>99065</payment_id><comment>6to pago</comment></payment><payment><amount>40</amount><local_amount>40</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>40</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>210201</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T19:55:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-14T16:45:33Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8140</id><name>Penina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Penina is married with children and lives in the village of Vailoa-uta.

Most of her family moved to New Zealand, and Faamata and her husband struggle to survive and support their four children in Samoa without relying on remittances.  Three years ago, Faamata applied for her first loan of ST 750 (approximately USD 300), and she used that money to buy chemicals, fertilizers and other supplies for the taro plantation that she keeps near her house.  Faamata’s taro farm represents the main source of income for her family.  Having repaid her initial loans and raised her family’s living standard with the income from the expanded taro plantation, Faamata is committed to continuing to invest in her business.  Faamata is seeking an additional SPBD loan for two purposes:  to buy supplies and equipment for the taro farm and to make necessary repairs to the floor of her house.

While one of her children has found employment, the other four remain unemployed.  Her family largely relied on remittances from relatives in New Zealand and Australia, but a few years ago, Pau was determined to stop relying on remittances.  She became a member of SPBD and used her first loan to start up her business making banana chips.  Having fully repaid her first loan and established her business, she used a second loan to make necessary improvements to her home.  Now with the second loan repaid in full and on time, Pau is seeking a third loan to make an additional investment in her business.  With these funds, she hopes to ensure a more consistent, daily supply of her banana chips to her buyers and thereby increase her

Not just being a mother of four but a shop-keeper!  I hope all business women feel the same way!”  After Alofa’s husband died, she needed to support her four children on her own.  In dire need, Alofa built up the courage to apply for an SPBD loan to open a small village store.  Now she is able to earn enough to meet the basic needs of her family and has earned the pride and self-satisfaction of being a successful entrepreneur.  Having repaid her first loan, Alofa is applying for an additional loan to upgrade her shop and enhance her product line.  A loan to Alofa will ensure that she can continue to keep her store fully stocked and in good condition so that she can provide food, clothing, shelter and an education for her four children.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26012</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Her small business is the sole source of income for her family.  By selling flavoured “ice cakes” and occasionally traditional hand-woven mats, she is currently able to bring in ST 150 – 200 per week (approximately USD 60 – 75).  However, this meagre income barely covers the expenses of her family, and Fusi strives to increase her family’s standard of living yet further.  With a loan Fusi can increase her supply of ice cakes to meet the demand in her village as well as enhance her product line by providing more flavours.  Additional income would go to ensuring that she can consistently provide the basic necessities for her family – food, shelter and clothing.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>26015</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Prior to joining SPBD in 2004, she had no job.  She applied for her first loan of ST 750 (approximately USD 300) to open a small grocery store in her village.  Now Ta’avaoga is the primary breadwinner for her family, which includes her parents and seven brothers.  She is confident that she can further grow her business to service the local village’s needs and increase her family’s standard of living.  To this end, Ta’avaoga is applying for another SPBD loan to expand her product line and ensure the basic necessities are consistently available in her store for the local villagers.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26017</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Ana is passionate about providing for the education of her children. She joined SPBD two years ago and has used several previous loans to upgrade her small village store.  Through these upgrades to the building structure and an expansion in product line, Ana has been able to earn enough income to fund the college expenses of two of her children.  She is very proud that she is able to send her children to the National University of Samoa.  The expansion of Ana’s store is not yet complete, however, and she is seeking additional funds to make further upgrades.  She is confident that there is enough demand in her village for a further enhanced product

She is living in district 7 Kabul, Afghanistan. She has a clay pan business with 5 years experience. She makes these items in her house. After completing the process her husband sells in the bazaar especially to the tourists and foreigners buying these materials. In the summer, she makes lots of clay pots with new designs and good quality and then she sells them where people come for holiday and sightseeing. To support her family financially, she prefers this business, so therefore she took a loan to buy more materials for her

Additionally, she received an award for being the top student in her Home Economics class, where she learned many useful things, like sewing and cooking.  &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Upon graduation, Asoleaga wanted to start her own restaurant, but the start-up expenses were too high.  She joined the SPBD program in order to finance the start-up of a smaller venture, a food stall that caters to the locals.  Asoleaga feels like the success of her small food stall is getting her closer to her goal of opening a full restaurant.  She is gaining confidence and learning a lot about how to manage a business.  A loan to Asoleaga, coupled with her hard work and savings, will get her even closer to meeting her

Her husband is a fisherman.  While Tuavale used to be employed by a manufacturing plant, she found her wages coupled with her husband’s income could not support her family’s needs and specifically, her sons’ education.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;In need of growing their income, Tuavale’s entrepreneurial spirit led her to leave her manufacturing job and use a start-up loan from SPBD to launch her own business.  Tuavale has a passion for designing fabric prints and used the loan funds to buy the fabric and materials to start a fabric design and printing business.  Now with Tuavale’s business her family has a decent income.  She turns a healthy profit and is seeking an additional loan to invest further in her business.  She will use the loan to buy more fabric paints and the materials for carving more designs.  She sells these printed fabrics to local seamstresses and shops, and they are used for making the dresses that are popular with Samoan women.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26036</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Buy

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosa is married with five children.  Prior to opening her small village store, neither Rosa nor her husband had work.  Neither of them graduated from secondary school, and this has made Rosa passionate about ensuring that each of her five children remain in school so that they can secure good jobs after graduation.  So far, her children have done well in school but saving enough for their school fees and supplies is nearly impossible for her and her husband.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Rosa took out an initial loan from SPBD in order to start up a small village store in her home.  Rosa’s house is open, with no walls or windows and so it is very difficult to pack and unpack the goods everyday to fill the makeshift shelves.  Having paid back the first loan, Rosa is requesting additional loan funds in order to re-stock her shop and build walls at the corner of her house where she is selling.  This will enable her to ensure the store goods remain dry and can be locked up to prevent theft.  Supporting Rosa with a loan will help her make a key enhancement to her business and help her earn the income to ensure she can continue to fund her children’s education.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>26038</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

While three of her grown children emigrated to New Zealand to seek better employment, the remaining five are young and are still with Tagiilima.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tagiilima and her husband are fishermen and rely on their fishing expeditions as their sole source of income to provide for their family and finance their children’s education.  With the help of an SPBD loan, they have been able to set up a small shop to sell their fishing catch and a few other goods.  With the first loan fully repaid, Tagiilima is seeking an additional loan to buy fishing gears and upgrade their fishing nets.  Someday, Tagiilima hopes that they can save enough money to expand their shop into a large village store and rely less on their daily catch to cover the expenses of their large family.

He buys by-products of maize, cotton, palm kernels, sunflowers and other cereals and packs them in bags of 20kgs to 50 kgs ready for resale.&lt;p&gt;Enock is planning to expand his business by stocking some other types of animal feeds which are professionally manufactured like broiler-mash and layer-mash for chickens. He also needs a bicycle which he will use to ferry  products purchased by his customers to their premises as an after-sale service.&lt;p&gt;Enock also keeps layers of which his wife is in charge.

She is married and has two sons. Her family was never rich and Mutabar could not get a good education and as a result could not get a well-paid job. Her husband was the only bread-winner but several years ago he lost his job. &lt;p&gt;Mutabar had a small table by her house where she sold fried sunflower seeds. She bought raw seeds, fried them and sold them by her house. When she started receiving loans she started at $15. Over time she increased the loan amount and her next loan will be $100. By using her next loan she would like to add other small goods in her sales, like matches, candy and others.

She brings her goods from Khujand and Istaravshan which is about a 1-2 hours drive from her town. She makes this trip once a week. &lt;p&gt;Kimyu says that if she had more money she could have bought more goods on each trip and save time and money for the road. &lt;p&gt;She has been receiving loans starting 2003. Her first loan was $80. When she learned that she needs to form a group of entrepreneurs like herself for a solidarity group guarantee, she asked her friends from the same market to join her and they started receiving loans together. Since then, her business has developed dramatically. Now she sells not only female clothes, but added men&apos;s and children&apos;s clothes. Since Kimyu works in open-air market, she dreams of having her own shop. The next loan will be used for a trip to the wholesale market.

When she started working in the market she used to sell only female clothes, then added men’s and kids&apos; clothes. She brings her goods from Khujand and Istaravshan weekly.

It was very difficult for her to leave her children and work in Russia, coming home only for couple of months per year. Therefore, as soon as she made enough money to start her own business, she did so. &lt;p&gt;Sanoat started her trade at the open-air market with a place 1 meter wide. She considered this place not busy and actively visited by customers, so her first goal was to afford renting better place in the market. She heard about MicroInvest 3 years ago and started receiving loans there. After receiving several loans she could afford to change her place in the market. At the beginning she had only $300 in her turnover and now has over $1200. She will use her next loan for the trip to the wholesale market to buy new seasonal goods.

He works as a dentist in the village called Kizil-pilol, of Isfara district. At the beginning his main income from his work as a dentist was enough to feed his family. Over time the family was growing and now Samadhon supports his wife, who doesn’t work, and four children. &lt;p&gt; From his childhood he has known how to take care of cows and decided to earn money by keeping livestock in his yard. His family helps him in this. When he is at work, his children and his wife take care of the cows and feed them. When he received his first loan he bought a bull-calf and fodder. Since then he bought several bulls and sold the ones that were big enough to sell at a good price. He would like to use his next loan for repairs of the cow-shed in his yard.

She has taken the loan for her son who runs a tailoring shop. At the start of her son&apos;s business they had few materials for tailoring, so they had few customers. It was difficult for them to keep going with their shop because they had to use the income from the shop to pay its rent. Then Shamila heard about Small Loans and she decided to start taking loans. Shamila is now in her first loan cycle and with this loan amount she would like to purchase more fabric in order to make more clothes and a machine with which her son can make clothes faster. She is pleased with the loan procedure because with the amount not only can they expand their business but they can also fulfill their daily expenses.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the son of the female entrepreneur, Shamila. In Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman on the Internet, but the loan is to the female entrepreneur.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>175</funded_amount><paid_amount>175</paid_amount><image><id>26106</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Shamila

She is a widow and runs a hairdressing salon. Up until the time of her husband&apos;s death, their life was normal but after she lost her husband during the war, life got really difficult for her. She didn&apos;t have any other choice except to start her own business. Hamida started by collecting some money from her relatives in order to start her own business but due to lack of money she faced lots of problems. After hearing about the loan process she took a loan and started to expand her business. Hamida has now finished 2 cycles of loans and now she wants to take the 3rd cycle to buy more materials for her salon in order to have more customers and earn enough income.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the entrepreneur, Hamida. In Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman&apos;s face on the

She took a loan for her youngest son who has a bicycle repair shop near the road. She can&apos;t work outside because she has a physical problem, so she took the loan for her son to buy bicycle parts. During the day, she visits her son and sometimes she works with him together at home fixing the bicycles. She hopes to complete the loan and buy a tailoring machine to help her son and sew clothes for their neighbors.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the son of the female entrepreneur, Sadeqa.

After graduating from the high school in her region, she entered the university in the nearby city of Cahul, but having had limited financial support from her parents she was unable to finish her studies. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She began working as a sales person at the outdoor market as an employee of a business owner. The income which she was receiving was very small and was enough only to meet the most basic needs. Two years ago she decided to try something else and applied for a permit to open a small business, rented a place in the market and started to work independently. Parascovia sells clothing and currently her sales are going very well, due in large part to her keen sense for what customers want and her willingness to explore new fashions. She is requesting a loan to extend her operation, specifically to rent the spot next the one she currently uses and to purchase initial inventory.

Production of carpets was considered to be the prestige profession and brought large income to workmen. Though nowadays when the market is filled with machine-made carpets, people still think that each house should have a handmade carpet. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tashbubu, from childhood, sitting near her mother and grandmother saw how the carpets were woven. With time, it became her main profession. Nowadays everybody knows Tashbubu as an experienced master of her work. As her husband and her son are in Russia and there was a lack of money in the family, Tashbubu began to look for a source of funding of her activity and came to MicroInvest. &lt;p&gt;She received her first loan in the amount of $150, and she bought fleece and dye for her products and increase the amount of production. Her daughter and daughter-in-law help her in their business. Step-by-step, expanding her business, she bought mechanical equipment for fleece processing. The last loan, in the amount of $150, she fully spent for the  purchase of raw material – fleece. With the new loan she wants to buy a new machine for weaving that will allow her to double the number of carpets produced.

She started going to the wholesale market herself and, in this way, made additional profit. She needs a new loan to purchase  new seasonal goods. She would like to receive $800. She also would like to change her trading place. In future, if everything goes according to her plan, she plans to rent a little shop.

In order to provide better financial support for them, she quit working in local public administration and began her own small business. Despite difficulties in getting started Maria, persisted and for over four years now she has been the proud owner of a small clothing store at the market in Cahul. Anyone who knows her will say that by nature she is a hardworking and honest person, and that trust is part of what has helped her get loyal customers. She now has an income that, while modest, allows her to better meet the needs of her family. Maria would like a loan to fund the purchase of new goods in order to diversify her product offerings and thereby begin growing her business.

He is a technical school graduate. He works at a factory and also, together with his wife, owns a small business selling clothing for children. In business since 1999, they now have a couple of vending kiosks in the local market. &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Vadim is a high-achiever. He received his first loan from “Nadiya Ukraine” in 2003. Today he has repaid 12 loans with no defaults. His perseverance, clear vision and passion for business have led to the expansion of his small venture. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Vadim has requested a loan for $1,000 to re-stock his inventory. He is planning to buy assorted clothing items for babies and children. Profits generated will be invested into further expansion of his business by purchasing a store which will increase his available retail space. Vadim believes his persistence and willpower are the keys to further successful growth in his trade. He knows that after he reaches this goal there will be new horizons, new challenges and new goals. He is ready to work hard to achieve true success while enjoying the journey along the way.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Вадим – одружений, в нього є двоє дітей. Після закінчення технікуму він працював на заводі. Потім вони з дружиною відкрили власну справу з продажу дитячого одягу. Вони займаються бізнесом з 1999 року, зараз в них вже дві торгові точки на одному з місцевих ринків. &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Вадим – вміє досягати поставленої мети. Першу позику від „Надії України” він отримав ще у 2003 році. Зараз він вже сплатив 12 попередніх позик без жодних прострочень. Наполегливість в роботі, чітке бачення та відданість власній справі сприяли розширенню його маленького бізнесу. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Вадим просить про позику в  1000 доларів для того, щоб розширити асортимент товарів. Він хоче закупити більше одягу для малюків та дітей. Отриманий прибуток він планує вкласти в подальше розширення свого бізнесу. В майбутньому Вадим планує купити власну крамницю. Він вважає, що його наполегливість та сила волі – це ті ключі, які сприятимуть успішному зростанню його торгівлі. Вадим чудово розуміє, що після того, як він досягне своєї мети, в нього з’являться нові горизонти, нові випробування та нові цілі. Він готовий наполегливо працювати для того, щоб досягти успіху, отримуючи від цієї роботи величезну насолоду.  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26157</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T17:05:55Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Vadim</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T10:31:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-12T09:18:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>22588</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31309</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41771</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:16Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53554</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66319</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T10:31:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-12T09:19:37Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8264</id><name>Joyce</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mama Joyce sells electical parts in her shop.

She runs several market kiosks where she sells a variety of men’s sports clothing and women’s clothing. Lidiya is known as a kind and hard working entrepreneur. She has a sharp business mind and has been able to gradually grow her operation into a successful enterprise. An outstanding client with Nadiya Ukraine, she has repaid a total of 17 loans to date. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lidiya has requested a loan that will add to her available working capital. Spring time leading into summer is a very busy time for market vendors as more customers take advantage of good weather and get out to shop. This additional capital will allow Lidiya to purchase necessary inventory so she can keep up with increased demand.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Лідії – 57 років. Вона – підприємець з Нікополя. Це місто розташоване в південній частині Центральної України. В неї декілька кіосків на місцевому ринку, вона торгує чоловічим спортивним та жіночим одягом. Усім відомо, що Лідія – привітна та працьовита. Її чіпкий розум та здатність мислити по-діловому допомогли їй досягти успіху в бізнесі. В Лідії чудова репутація в „Надії України”, вона вчасно сплатила усі 17 позик, які отримала в організації. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Лідія просить про позику для того, щоб поповнити власний робочий капітал. Навесні та влітку в підприємців на ринку завжди дуже багато роботи, бо стає тепліше та багато покупців ходять по покупки. Додаткові кошти дозволять Лідії придбати необхідний інвентар та задовольнити зростаючий попит.  &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26160</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Increase clothing inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T17:14:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lidiya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T13:53:10Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>400</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23612</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32735</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43345</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55291</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68068</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T13:53:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:38Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8267</id><name>Julia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Julia is a travelling merchant and takes her products (shirts, briefcases, cosmetics, etc) in the center of the country (other cities and smaller villages).

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Natalya runs a small business selling just about a little bit of everything.  From telephones, tea pots and curling irons, to manicure sets, writing pens and women’s purses, she has been able to build her business by marketing those practical items that everybody can use. She operates from a little space at an indoor mall in Nikopol, Ukraine. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Before starting her own business, Natalya worked as a salesperson for another store. This gave her valuable retailing experience which has benefited her as she has started her own enterprise. The assistance she has gained through loans from “Nadiya Ukraine” has also helped in her business development. Available funding has enabled her to maintain stability and growth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Natalya has requested a loan that will enable her to purchase additional inventory in bulk. She is always on the lookout for good prices from suppliers that will give her the ability to make a profit. By having an adequate amount of capital available, she can maximize her opportunities and continue developing a solid business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;В Наталії є власний невеличкий бізнес. Вона торгує усім потроху, починаючи з телефонів, чайників, прасок для волосся і закінчуючи манікюрними наборами, ручками та жіночими сумочками. Бізнес Наталії, розташований в торговому центрі в м Нікополь, розвивався завдяки торгівлі усіма цими практичними товарами. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;До того, як почати власний бізнес Наталія працювала продавцем в крамниці. Завдяки цій роботі вона отримала необхідний досвід роздрібної торгівлі, який знадобився їй, коли вона починала власну справу. Позики, які Наталія отримала від „Надії України”, також сприяли розвитку її бізнесу. Додаткові кошти дали їй можливість досягти стабільності та  отримати додаткові прибутки.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Наталія просить про позику, яка допоможе їй закупити товар оптом. Вона завжди уважно слідкує за цінами постачальників, низькі закупівельні ціни допомагають їй отримати прибуток від продажу. Отримавши необхідні додаткові кошти, Наталія зможе реалізувати власні можливості й надалі розвивати стабільний бізнес. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26162</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T17:03:06Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nataliya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T21:18:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>400</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23613</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32736</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:38Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43346</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55292</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68069</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T21:18:00Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:40Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8269</id><name>Janet</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Janet sells fabrics from textile companies in her locality.

It is difficult for her to support both her old mother and her husband, who has injured feet, as well as her 3 children. Thuy&apos;s sons are students at secondary school. Her daughter is a student at high school. Thuy&apos;s family has only 1000 square meters for growing rice. Thuy&apos;s hut is 40 square meters, not enough for 6 people. &lt;p&gt;Thuy has grocery store in front of her hut. However, Thuy&apos;s main income from her grocery store is only $6 per person/month. She is very eager to receive a loan of $75 in order to increase the variety of goods in her grocery store. She believes that if her grocery store is expanded, she can get a higher income so that she is able to pay for school fees, and both her mother&apos;s and her husband&apos;s medicine. Thuy is going to repay the loan monthly.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>26193</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

He began his business when he found that it was no longer easy to find employment because of his age. He plays mobile audio announcements from the streets and distributes publicity fliers. “I have always said that age doesn’t stop anyone from being a useful person who can take care of himself. That is why I began this business which has allowed my wife and me to progress. Nevertheless, the sound system that I use was purchased 10 years ago, and it is starting to break down. That is why I am asking for a $1,200 dollar loan to purchase a sound system more suitable for the job. This will help me to be more efficient in my mobile publicity business and my clients will see more success in the products that they offer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;El Sr. M. tiene un negocio de publicidad ambulante desde hace 10 años. &#13;&#10;Este negocio lo inició porque debido a su edad ya no era fácil encontrar empleo.&#13;&#10;Hace perifoneo por las calles y reparte volantes de publicidad.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Siempre he dicho que la edad no es obstáculo para seguir siendo una persona útil y obtener su propio sustento, por eso emprendí este negocio que me ha permitido sacar adelante a mi esposa y a mi mismo.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sin embargo, el equipo de sonido que utilizo lo compré hace 10 años, y ya está empezando a fallar.  Por lo que requiero de un crédito de 1,200 dólares para adquirir un equipo de sonido que sea apto para mi trabajo.  Esto me ayudará a ser más eficiente en mi servicio de publicidad ambulante y mis clientes tendrán mas éxito en los productos que ofrecen.

She sets up shop outside her home which is just off the main highway that connects her home of San Pedro de Macoris with the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo. This loan will help her improve the quality of her restaurant by being able to purchase table cloths, additional chairs and tables, as well as more food for her rapidly growing customer base.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;NOTE: Mercedes is one of five microentrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses. Each of the five members will receive a share of this $1,000 loan for their respective businesses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their share of this loan together.

national capital on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic. She travels to the city to purchase jewellery, which she then sells to specific clients which are growing by word of mouth among her many friends and satisfied customers. The high value of her wares make it unwise to display her merchandise openly on a street corner, so she operates based on referals and makes house calls.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This loan will allow her to purchase more of the jewellery she sells, specifically rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings made of silver, pearls and particularly the native Dominican stones of Ambar - shaded in dark orange and brown tint - and Larimar, named after its hues that look like the blue waters of the Caribbean Sea. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Sandra is the leader of her solidarity group called &apos;Mujeres en Desarollo&apos; or &quot;Women in Development.&quot; She and her business represent the four other members of her group, who each will receive a share of this $1,000 loan to fund their respective businesses. As members of a solidarity group, Sandra and the other four micro-entrepreneurs have gone through Esperanza´s business training courses and have proven to be committed to their businesses to provide for their families. If a member of the group is unable to make a payment, the other members are responsible for making up the difference and helping the person to improve. This group-lending method creates a social support network within the community as well as an accountability system to ensure that not only are loans paid back on time, but that the loan capital is invested in developing their business and providing for the basic necessities of their families.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26268</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Beauty

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Sara C. has created a business selling various food staples as well as new and used clothing. Her business supports her family and she hopes to fulfill her goal of being able to send all of her children to college. Her oldest son, Keni (17) assists her after school by looking after his two younger siblings, Sandra (12) and Luis (8) while their mother works. This loan will allow Sara to have the capital she needs to invest in developing her business. Right now she has limited resources and a small inventory, but her business plan and training that she went through with Esperanza has prepared her to move ahead in her business growth process with this first loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;NOTE: Sara is one of 5 micro-entrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their shares of this $1,000 loan together. If a member is unable to pay in full on time, the group is responsible for making up the deficit before a payment can be made. Investors in this loan will receive an update on Sara&apos;s progress as well as that of the entire group. This group-lending method strengthens social needs in a community and ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their business and family.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26280</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She grow up with her parents, and had few opportunities to study due to the family&apos;s lack of financial resources. This made her enter the world early, having to interrupt her studies for an early marriage.&lt;p&gt;The family has a micro-business building furniture. The raw material used is wood, which is acquired in the large lumber companies in the city of Maputo, about 30 km from the town of Boane, where her carpentry shop is located.&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2006, through neighbors, she found out about Hluvuku-Adsema and, since she needed to increase her stock of wood, and didn&apos;t have a place to turn to for the loan, this was a great opportunity. With a loan of US$600, she plans to purchase wood for building various types of furniture ordered by her customers and to increase the family income to apply to her carpentry business.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her activity has a larger impact on the community because, in addition to providing a job for three people, she makes high quality furniture available at accessible prices near to where her customers are located.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Portuguese by Naomi Baer, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Localização:  Bairro 1– Boane &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Cliente: Constância José C. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sector de actividade: Transformação&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Valor de empréstimo: 15.000,00MT (600.00US$)&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Aplicação de montante: Compra de madeira para fabrico de mobília&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Inicio: 10/04/07&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Fim:    31/03/2008&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Constância José C. de 27 anos de idade, natural de Bilene, Província de Gaza. Cresceu sob responsabilidade dos Pais, teve poucas oportunidades de estudar for falta de recursos financeiros na família que lhe fez vir ao mundo, teve de interromper os estudos  para casamento prematuro.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;A família possui uma micro empresa de fabrico de mobília anexo a residência, a sua principal matéria prima é madeira que é adquirida nas grandes serrações da cidade de Maputo que dista 30 Kms da vila de Boane, onde localiza-se a sua carpintaria.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Nos finais do ano de 2006 por indicações dos vizinhos teve conhecimento de existência  da Hluvuku-Adsema e como necessitava de aumentar o stock de madeira e não tinha onde recorrer para obter empréstimo, esta foi a grande oportunidade.&#13;&#10;Com empréstimo de 600.00US$ pretende aplicar na compra de madeira para fabrico de vários tipos de mobília encomendada pelos clientes e aumentar a renda familiar.&#13;&#10;para aplicação do seu  negócio na carpintaria.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A sua actividade tem um impacto  maior na comunidade porque para alem de providenciar emprego para três pessoas, coloca a mobília de qualidade e apreços acessíveis mais perto do cliente.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>26281</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Furniture

Pedro de Macoris, located on the south coast of the Dominican Republic. She runs a business selling filtered water packets and coconut-flavoured ice cream. Since potable tap water is not available in most cities throughout the Dominican Republic, filtered water is in high demand, whether for rehydrating against the high Caribbean temperatures or to wash and prepare food.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This loan will allow her to increase her inventory of water, which is filtered and sealed into plastic bags in about 6-ounce quantities. She will also be able to purchase ice and ingredients for making frozen sweets so that she can take full advantage of her new refrigerator.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;NOTE: This $1,000 loan will go to fund Noris&apos; business, as well as four other businesses within her solidarity group. She and four other micro-entrepreneurs in her community came to Esperanza and formed their own group, which they named &apos;Por Fe Vivimos&apos; or &quot;We Live by Faith.&quot; They have all gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training program and will receive shares of this $1,000 loan to invest in their respective businesses and pay back the loan together. The entire group must pay in full and on time, otherwise group members must make up the deficit before any payment can be made. This creates accountability among the group members because each one shares in the success and struggles of the other members in their group.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26284</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft

Her early marriage forced her to interrupt her studies when she was at level 4. She had her third child when she was abandoned by her husband (who got together with another woman) and in order to survive, she started a business selling beef. She purchased the cow in the provinces in the center of Mozambique (Tete, Sofala and Manica). Year later, she decided to change businesses.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She started to raise chickens on her own, based on the experience of family members who had done the same kind of business. Through neighbors, she found out about Hluvuku-Adsema in 2006 and approached them to get more information about how to access credit.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With this loan, she plans to increase the quantity of chickens and reduce the production cycles in order to always have chicken meat available for the community, significantly increasing her monthly income. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her activity has a positive impact on the community, since she provides a job for herself and her oldest child, who is the father of 2 children, in addition to ensuring the supply of animal protein for her community. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Portuguese by Naomi Baer, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Localização:  Bairro 7 -  Boane &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Cliente: Sineta Mário M. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sector de actividade: Avicultura&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Valor de empréstimo: 19.000,00MT (775.00US$)&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Aplicação de montante : Compra de pintos de engorde.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Inicio: 10/04/07&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Fim:    31/03/2008     &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sineta Mario M. de 39 anos de idade, natural de boane, tem 3 filhos. O casamento pre-maturo obrigou lhe a interromper os estudos quando fazia a 4@ classe. Tinha o seu terceiro filho, quando foi abandona da pelo marido (que foi juntar-se com outra mulher) e como forma de sobrevivência começou um negocio de venda de carne de vaca, comprava o gado bovino nas províncias do centro de Moçambique (Tete, Sofala e Manica). Anos depois decidiu mudar do tipo de negocio.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Começou a criar frangos de engorde com meios próprios, baseando-se na experiência  antiga dos seus familiares que outrora fazia o mesmo tipo de negocio.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Através dos vizinhos soube da existência da Hluvuku - Adsema em 2006 e tendo aproximado para obter mais informações sobre as condições de acesso ao crédito. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Com este empréstimo pretende aumentar a quantidade de pintos de engorde e reduzir os ciclos de produção para ter frango sempre disponível para a comunidade, aumentando significativamente a sua receita mensal.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A sua actividade tem um impacto positivo na comunidade, pois providencia emprego para ela própria e seu

In the traditional Samoan household, there is little, if any, furniture and mats are an important part of daily life.  Mats are spread out on the floor of the traditional, open structured Samoan house (fale) and used to sit on for family gatherings and meals as well as village meetings.  Aipopo is one of the Samoan women that keeps the tradition of mat weaving alive; she uses all local, natural materials such as palm and other leaves (taiga laufala) to make her mats.  Aipopo is able to sell mats to local villagers for family use as well as to make fine, large mats for export to America.  Abroad, Aipopo’s mats can command high prices.  Aipopo is seeking a loan so that she can purchase the materials necessary to continue to make fine Samoan mats for export.  A loan to Aipopo not only helps her provide for her children, but also supports the traditional Samoan craft of mat weaving.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>26287</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Patchwork</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Buy

She runs her own bakery, which allows her to directly provide for much of the food for her household as well as a steady source of income to take care of immediate needs. Gladis requests this loan to purchase a bread-maker and additional ingredients such as flour and oil so that she can create enough bread to be a main distributor in her rural town outside the capital of San Pedro de Macoris. The profits she makes are invested in her business and go to savings for her children&apos;s education, which she says is one of her primary dreams for her children.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;NOTE: This $1,000 will fund Gladis&apos; business plus 4 others in her community. She and four additional entrepreneurs have formed a solidarity group that received business training from Esperanza and will be responsible for paying back this loan together as they develop their respective businesses. This group-lending methodology fosters accountability among the members because they all must pay in full and on time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26291</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase additional bread-making machine, baking ingredients and coffee</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>San Pedro de Macorís</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>19 -70.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T01:06:34Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Gladis</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T08:00:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-27T09:17:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17755</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-27T09:18:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26575</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-27T09:21:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36096</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-27T09:23:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47128</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-27T09:23:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>59425</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>72796</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T08:00:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-27T09:25:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8353</id><name>Animoe</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Animoe’s husband died many years ago; his death left her alone with two small daughters to support.  She raised her daughters alone, using her small vegetable garden to bring in the necessary income.  Today, Animoe lives alone in the Samoan village of Aleisa.  She still uses her garden, in which she mainly cultivates ginger, to support herself.  Animoe works hard to care for her gardens, and every Saturday she travels to the market to sell the ginger and other vegetables she has grown.  Animoe has been an active, upstanding member of her village’s SPBD Center.  She was recently elected the President of the Aleisa SPBD Center and has also held the post of Secretary.  Having repaid previous loans in full, Animoe is now eligible for her fourth SPBD loan, which she will use for seeds and fertilizers to further enhance the productivity of her Ginger

Leveraging her horticulture talents, Logo can often bring in more than that by selling the flowers and plants that she raises in her backyard.  Logo’s talents are so well known in her village that her local customers generally seek her out at home to purchase her renowned flora.  The income from her sales is a necessary contribution to meeting the needs of her family of six.  Counted among her dependents is Logo’s elderly mother, who relies on Logo and her husband for care and financial support.  Providing a loan to Logo will allow her to purchase the additional supplies (seeds, fertilizer, pots) necessary to expand the supply and the types of potted plants, flowers and herbs she can offer her

The income from her sewing business is critical for her family being able to afford the school fees and school supplies necessary to educate her children.  Luana works 6–7 days every week to make popular Samoan clothing for sale to local villagers.  She makes the dresses that Somoan women commonly wear (Puletasis) and the button down shirts that Somoan men typically wear (Aloa).  Luana is very active in her village’s SPBD Center and serves as Secretary.  Luana has been able to use past SPBD loans to buy the materials and supplies necessary to start up her small sewing business.  Her solid track record of on-time repayment makes her eligible for her fourth loan, which she will use to expand her product line to include printed fabrics, which she will design and print herself.

A. has turned her cooking skills into a steady source of income for her and her two children - Rudy (19) and Wilki (15). After suffering a severe injury while working in an industrial Free Zone near her home in San Pedro de Macoris, she lost the use of her left arm, but began cooking and selling home-cooked meals to families in her community to support her family financially. This loan will go towards purchasing new equipment and more food to increase her production and lead her to greater profits, which will help her save up enough to one day purchase a prosthetic limb.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;NOTE: Clara and four other micro-entrepreneurs are part of a solidarity group designed by Esperanza to create a social network and accountability system. Clara and every other member in her group will receive an equal share of this $1,200 loan to develop their own businesses to support their families. They also provide ongoing advice for each other and help one another make payments on their loans. This group-lending method has proven to be a highly effective way to ensure accountability and support.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>26297</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase cooking utensils, additional pots and pans, meat and vegetables</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>San Pedro de Macorís</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>19 -70.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T01:06:51Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Clara</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T09:18:00Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-05-27T09:17:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>17756</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-27T09:18:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>26576</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-27T09:21:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36097</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-27T09:23:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>47129</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-27T09:23:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>59426</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>72797</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T09:18:00Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-27T09:25:52Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8358</id><name>J Socorro</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. G. owns a small restaurant.

Her and her family’s sole source of income is the family fishing business that Pasikalia and her husband work together to manage.  While her husband is the primary fisherman, Pasikalia is adept at planning / optimizing the amounts she takes to market and the prices she offer.  Pasikalia has been able to fund expansion of the family’s business via SPBD loans, and with a strong history of on-time repayment, she is now eligible for her fourth SPBD loan, which she will use for upgrading the fishing equipment.  While their ability to secure a good catch is often dependent on the weather, a good week with cooperative weather can bring in almost ST 1,000 (USD 350) per week, making the family’s fishing business a viable source of income for Pasikalia’s

She is seeking her fourth loan, with the previous three loans having been fully paid on schedule.  She has used the SPBD loans to fund the start-up and growth of her fishing business, which is her sole means of support.  Utuagiagi lives in a small Samoan village by the sea and is one of the few female fishermen on the island.  Most women who participate in fishing industries do so on or close to the shore, but Utuagiagi takes the risks inherent in going out to sea alone in her small boat to increase her catch.  An additional loan will help Utuagiagi obtain the necessary supplies and repairs to continue to support herself via her fishing production.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26317</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Fund

In order to improve the life of her family and her children, she set up a canteen at the local primary school.  She cooks and sells food at the school and can earn up to ST 95 (approximately USD 36) a day; this income is a critical contribution to covering her family’s expenses and makes her the primary breadwinner in her family.  Soli has used a previous SPBD loan to purchase equipment, and her previous success now qualifies her for a second loan.  She has hopes of enlarging her business, now that she sees how high the local demand is for her food.  She will use additional loan funds to purchase canteen supplies (e.g. flour, salt, sugar, ice) as well as equipment (e.g. a cooler, thermos).

Faalua began her taro plantation with funds from her first SPBD loan.  In her first planting, she raised 600 taro plants.  After two harvests of similar size, she found she had raised enough money to greatly increase her family’s income and help buy food for her many grandchildren.  Faalua’s family is very encouraging of her efforts, as it has not only made a valuable contribution to the family finances but has also been a source of satisfaction and pride for Faalua.  Faalua is committed to growing her plantation further.  Some of the income she saved from her initial two harvests went to buy additional taro seeds, and she is currently raising 1,200 taro plants.  She has set her goal even higher, and with her first SPBD fully repaid, Faalua is seeking an additional loan to purchase more seeds and buy supplies such as a wheelbarrow, knives and weed killer.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>26363</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase

Telesia and her husband are a talented couple, and via three previous SPBD loans, they have been able to leverage their talents and expand their business.  Now, the jewelry they make sells well at the local flea market, and they supply a large retail store with women’s and children’s clothes.

Prior to Imeleta joining SPBD, both Imeleta and her husband were unemployed and relied on the help of neighbors and nearby relatives for basic necessities such as food and water.  The women in Imeleta’s village encouraged her to join SPBD.  She did, and with her first loan, she was able to start up a small village store.  Since then, Imeleta and her family have seen small but steady gains in their standard of living.  Also, Imeleta happily reports that the self-satisfaction she has gained as a result of her business endeavors has contributed to a marked improvement in her relations with her husband and children.  She remains grateful to the other village women who have continued to counsel her on running a small business.  Imeleta’s goal is to grow her business to bring in enough income for her to equip her home with water and electricity.  To achieve that goal, Imeleta is seeking further financing in order to expand her shop’s stock of goods.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>26366</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

Leala is now seeking to expand her vegetable farm and increase the variety and supply of goods that she brings to the flea market for her customers.  A loan to Leala would help her purchase the vegetable seeds and fertilizers she needs to expand her business.

She has three grown daughters and one 12-year old, adopted son.  Three years ago, as an attempt to raise her family’s standard of living and provide for her son’s school supplies and fees, Penuafa joined SPBD.  With the initial loan, Penuafa set up a pancake stand, and sold these Samoan delights in her local village.  She used additional SPBD financing to expand her business into making donuts and now has a steady stream of happy customers from the village primary school.  Penuafa has repaid all previous SPBD loans without missing a single payment.  She firmly believes that with hard work and an additional loan, she can expand her product line still further and concurrently make some much-needed improvements to her village home.  Penuafa’s longer-term goal is to set up a full-scale bakery shop.  SPBD is confident that she will continue to work hard and will eventually reach that goal.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>26372</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>:

start her own business, she had little previous experience in earning her own income.  Susana’s mother was famous in the village for her flower gardens, and after her mother’s death, Susana decided to take over her mother’s garden and use it to develop a business that could provide for her and her children.  Susana used her initial SPBD loan to acquire her business license.  Since then, Susana has secured two large, regular customers – nearby beach resorts that cater to the tourists that flock to the white sand beaches in her region of Samoa.  Susana is anxious to secure another loan to further expand her business.  She is clearing space for additional flower gardens, and her dream is to someday grow her gardens into a full-scale nursery.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>850</funded_amount><paid_amount>850</paid_amount><image><id>26375</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>gardening

Therefore, he chose to sell food instead of another type of goods. The location of his business is in a main market of the town- “Panjshanbe”.

By now, Manzuma feels comfortable with her business, and she goes to the wholesale market herself. She would like to open a second business site where she would be selling women’s clothes. Her son will be helping her after school. She will invest the money she has collected and will add the new loan to open the second site.

She is single. Samira and her brother are in business together. She and three other sisters create flowers in their home, and her brother sells them at his shop in the main market place. He also does the marketing for the business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She is on her 4th cycle loan from AFSG, and these loans have enabled her to grow her business. Now she is able to continue her studies that she missed during the Taliban years. She could not have done this without the help of the AFSG loan program. She is requesting another loan of $400 to further expand her business and improve her family&apos;s standard of living and education.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the brother of Samira. With some families in Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman on the internet, but the loan is to the female entrepreneur.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Sok Sa Roeun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T06:23:01Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T03:17:37Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8408</id><name>Beatrice</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. Beatrice O. had 6 months of training before she started her retail business in the year 2004.

Najib lives in District 6 of Kabul City. She is married to A. Alem and has nine family members. She and her son operate a grocery store. They buy grocery goods from the main market in Kabul and sell them in their shop. Baheja has finished her 1st cycle loan and now wants to begin a 2nd cycle. When they first opened their shop, they weren&apos;t able to offer much to their customers. Thanks to the AFSG loan program, they were able to increase their stock and their income. Now Baheja is requesting a loan of $225 so she can continue to grow her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the husband or relative of the female entrepreneur.  In Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman to the internet, but the loan is to the female

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Sout Sovorn has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T17:32:38Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T03:36:46Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8419</id><name>Anonymous</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en/></texts></description><status>refunded</status><funded_amount>0</funded_amount><image><id>726677</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Soft Drinks</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To expand the grocery store and improve his farm so that they can save some money to buy a small home.</use><location><country_code>VN</country_code><country>Viet Nam</country><geo><level>country</level><pairs>16.166667 107.833333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>41</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-19T22:15:28Z</posted_date><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Anonymous</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-05-03T23:44:36Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>100</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>100</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-03T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-01-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-02-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-03-03T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>10</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>10</amount><local_amount>10</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-04T09:17:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-15T04:09:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>10</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20230</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>10</amount><local_amount>10</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-04T09:18:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-07-15T04:09:13Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>10</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>28942</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-19T23:44:36Z</funded_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8420</id><name>Mercy O.</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>A woman of age 38, Mercy O. is married and has four children.

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Seang Soeun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T02:31:03Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T03:31:37Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8428</id><name>Shahnoza</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Shahnoza has been engaged in trade for 4 years.

Although she has a University degree, the small salary at her previous job forced her to leave and start working at the market. At this point, her business has grown, and she has a much higher amount of turnover. Since she works at an open-air market, her main goal is to improve her working conditions. She would like to use the next loan to buy construction materials and repair the roof of her business site with the help of her husband.

To start her business, she borrowed $200 from her neighbor who was also working at the market. Her neighbor helped Zulfira a lot. When she started trading, she started with clothes for little kids and infants. Over time, she added men’s clothes into her assortment of goods. She would like to add towels and bed linens to her business, as she has noticed that demand is high for these goods. For this, she needs a loan of $1000.

She needed money for her business but did not have collateral, so she helped create a solidarity group in order to receive a loan from MicroInvest as a solution for her business. Since 2005, she has been receiving loans from MicroInvest. All of the members of her group are satisfied with that.

She makes the trips to the wholesale market herself. Her goal is to improve the quality of the goods sold. That means she will have to buy more expensive goods, but she thinks they will be in demand because of quality. She will use the next loan for the trip to the wholesale market.

She is married and has five family members. She and her husband have a grocery and vegetable shop. In the beginning, her husband just sold vegetables, and it was difficult to meet their daily expenses. When Sharifa finished her first loan cycle, they were able to open a grocery store, buy groceries from the main market in Kabul and sell them at their shop. This made them better able to meet expenses. Now Sharifa is ready to begin her second loan cycle so they can continue to improve their business and meet the needs of their family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the husband or relative of the female entrepreneur.  In Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman to the internet but the loan is to the female

Ahmad Shah lives in District 13 of Kabul City. She is married and has four family members. She and her son have a fresh fruit cart. In her first loan cycle, she bought fruits for her son to sell from the cart so they could earn money for their family&apos;s daily needs. She plans to continue in the loan program so she can establish a shop for her son which will allow more room for goods and increase their sales. She thanks AFSG for providing loan opportunities to her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the husband or relative of the female entrepreneur.

D. was born in 1941 and lives in District 13 of Kabul City. She is married and has four family members. She and her husband own a fresh fruit cart. She was married young, wasn&apos;t able to complete her education, and has faced a lot of financial problems. To overcome these problems, she decided to take part in her husband&apos;s business. This wasn&apos;t easy, as they didn&apos;t have the capital they needed to expand their sales. Then she heard about the loan programs. Her first loan enabled her to supply more customers. She has finished her 1st loan cycle, and wishes to participate in the 2nd cycle. Khorshid has learned that if she is able to purchase more fruit, she will have more sales and increase her income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the husband or relative of the female entrepreneur.  In Afghanistan, it is culturally unacceptable to post a picture of a woman to the internet but the loan is to the female

Zohra is requesting a loan to improve this business and her family&apos;s lives. She is grateful that these loan programs have been established and are so successful at helping poor people raise their standards of living. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***Note: The picture featured in this business profile is the husband or relative of the female entrepreneur.

Fotima remained with her two children. She started working in the market and first had sales turnover that was hardly enough to purchase one bag of goods.  She now has over 10 years of experience in trade. She constantly developed her business from her profits. In the course of time, her business increased. When Fotima learned about the microcredit program of MicroInvest, she decided to take a loan and joined one of the solidarity groups.  Members of the group were also businesswomen like she was. The first loan was 80 dollars, and she spent it for an assortment of goods as she did before. As her work experience and credit increased, she increased the size of the loan. Currently, she has applied for $500 dollars. Since she started receiving loans, the assortment of goods that she sells has increased twice.  She will use the next loan to improve the condition of her place in the market and order shelves for her goods.

Hakim lives is District 15 of Kabul and is married. He runs a shop where he sells blankets and shoes. He buys blankets from Pakistani traders and sells them at the market. His business did not start well because he had little money, and so had few items to sell, therefore less customers. He heard about the AFSG loan program from a friend and decided to participate so he can develop his business. He is requesting a loan so he can increase his stock and reach more customers.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Leonid offers vehicle repair services. He has very skillful hands and can fix any auto problem. He also restores used cars and sells them at exceptional prices. Presently, his gross revenue per month is about $4,000 – $6,000, and his monthly net profit amounts to $1,400.   &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Leonid is a very patient and professional man. He has partnered with “Nadiya Ukraine” since 2003 and has used previous loans for business expansion. He has been able to purchase new equipment and construct a big garage which he uses for his repair shop and as a paint booth. The new equipment and garage facility have helped him repair and sell more vehicles at reasonable prices.   &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Leonid is requesting a loan of $800 to purchase some additional equipment to use in straightening, grinding, puttying, and painting cars as well as to do engine mechanical work and all other types of repairs. Leonid believes that good quality equipment will help him provide excellent repair service to his customers and further increase his ability to restore and sell used cars.     &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;В Леоніда є власна автомайстерня. Він дуже талановитий, може полагодити будь-яку проблему. Він також займається відновленням автомобілів, а потім продає їх за помірними цінами. Зараз його щомісячний валовий дохід складає приблизно 4000 – 6000 доларів, чистий прибуток складає 1400 доларів.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Леонід – дуже терплячий, він справжній професіонал. Він співпрацює з „Надією України” вже з 2003 року, усі попередні позики використовував для розширення власного бізнесу. Леонід придбав нове обладнання та відбудував великий гараж, який зараз використовує в якості майстерні, де ремонтує та красить автомобілі. Нове облаштування та гаражне приміщення допомогли йому відновити та продати за помірними цінами багато автомобілів.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Леонід просить про позику в 800 доларів для того, щоб придбати додаткове обладнання для рихтування, шпаклювання та відновлення панелей автомобілів, а також для механічного ремонту двигунів, тощо. Леонід вважає, що якісне обладнання допоможе йому забезпечити чудове обслуговування покупців і він зможе надалі відновлювати та продавати старі автомобілі. &#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>27286</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Vehicle Repairs</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>To purchase tools for car repair</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Berdyansk</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.716667 36.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-12T06:30:15Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Leonid</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T23:28:13Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-13T09:16:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>22810</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T09:18:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31678</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-13T09:18:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>42165</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-13T09:18:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>54032</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66796</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T23:28:13Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-13T09:19:05Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8507</id><name>María Luisa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mrs. G. and her daughter run a beauty salon located in their home, having built a room just for their business.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Galina is married and has one grown daughter. For a while she worked as a trolley-bus controller selling tickets to passengers. She also worked part-time as a market vendor. However, Galina wanted to be self-employed, so six years ago she decided to start her own business. Today she has four market vending facilities – two selling dishware sets and ceramics, and two locations selling clothing and shoes. She has hired several employees who help her with sales. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Galina realizes that lending services have been the engine pushing her business forward. The seventeen loans she has received and repaid from “Nadiya Ukraine” have helped her business grow. With financial assistance Galina was able to purchase two more vending facilities and hire two people to work for her. Currently, she has about $8,000 in inventory. Her monthly gross revenue amounts to $2,000.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Galina has requested a loan of $1,200 to open her fifth vending facility and start selling dishware and ceramic goods in a new location. She is planning to buy tableware, dinnerware and porcelain sets at wholesale prices that she can re-sell in her new kiosk. Galina is hoping that the expansion of her trade will help her meet high demand for dishware and boost her sales.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Галина – одружена, в неї є доросла дочка. Певний час вона працювала контролером в тролейбусі. Потім змінила місце роботи, почала працювати на ринку реалізатором. Проте, Галина хотіла працювати на себе. Отже, 6 років тому вона вирішила почати власну справу. Зараз в неї 4 торгові точки: два кіоски з продажу посуду та кераміки, два – з продажу одягу та взуття. В роботі Галині допомагають декілька реалізаторів. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Галина розуміє, що кредитні послуги – це той двигун, який штовхає її вперед. Сімнадцять позик, які вона отримала від „Надії України” сприяли розвитку її бізнесу. Завдяки фінансовій підтримці Галина змогла придбати дві торгові точки та взяти на роботу ще двох реалізаторів. Зараз в неї приблизно 8000 доларів в товарі. Її щомісячний валовий дохід складає 2000 доларів.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Галина просить про позику в 1200 доларів для того, щоб відкрити п’яту торгову точку з продажу посуду та керамічних виробів. Вона планує закупити посуд, порцелянові набори за оптовими цінами для подальшої роздрібної торгівлі в новому кіоску.

Like many trained Ukrainian professionals, however, Vartiter now works as a market vendor due to a lack of good paying professional jobs.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;After working for a time as a leather goods specialist, Vartiter started her current business, which she has now operated for several years. Nadiya Ukraine has previously assisted her with four different loans. She has requested an additional loan of $1000 for two purposes. She needs to purchase additional inventory for her current business, and she would also like to use some money to help open a second sales kiosk where she could begin selling clothing items. She is hoping that by expanding her overall business enterprise and moving into a new area of retail she will be able to increase her income and improve her standard of living.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Вартітер – власниця невеликого кіоску, вона торгує кухонним приладдям, посудом та обладнанням. Вона отримала освіту журналіста. Вчилася в престижному вузі ім. Тараса Шевченка в Києві, а цей вуз вважається одним з найкращих в Україні. Однак, як і багато інших спеціалістів, через брак робочих місць Вартітер зараз працює на ринку продавцем. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Певний час вона торгувала шкіряними виробами, потім вирішила  почати власну справу. Займається цим бізнесом вже декілька років. Від „Надії України” отримала 4 позики, вчасно їх сплативши. Зараз Вартітер просить про наступну позику в 1000 доларів через декілька причин. Вона хоче закупити додатковий інвентар, щоб розширити асортимент в своєму кіоску, а також використати іншу частину коштів для того, щоб відкрити другу торгову точку з продажу одягу. Вартітер сподівається, що завдяки розширенню власного бізнесу вона зможе підвищити власні прибутки та покращити рівень життя своєї родини.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>27297</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase inventory and open new location</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:58:35Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Vartiter</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T06:51:41Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>400</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:23Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23615</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32738</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43348</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55294</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68071</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T06:51:41Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:46Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8511</id><name>Faustina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Faustina N. is a master of hair dressing and has been a client of Kraban Support Foundation for years now.

He started his small business when he was in his late 20’s and gradually, though much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Vitali has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man. Funding from “Nadiya Ukraine” has been instrumental in helping Vitali build his business. His first loan was for $500 and since that time he has benefited from nine additional loans while establishing a great credit history.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He has requested $1200 to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Vitali. He would like to buy a supply of men’s sportswear and men’s and women’s jean clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season. Vitali appreciates the availability of funding through Nadiya Ukraine. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Віталій – молодий підприємець, займається продажем одягу на місцевому ринку &#13;&#10;м. Нікополь. Він відкрив власну справу, коли йому було лише 20 з чимось. Віталій наполегливо працював й поступово його бізнес ставав успішним.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;У Віталія є усі якості та здібності, які необхідні підприємцю для успіху. Цілеспрямований, працьовитий та пунктуальний  - він дуже ділова людина. Фінансова підтримка від „Надії України” сприяла розвитку бізнесу Віталія. Розмір його першої позики складав 500 доларів. З того часу він вчасно сплатив 9 позик, в нього склалася чудова кредитна історія. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Віталій просить про позику в 1200 доларів, тому що хоче поповнити свій робочий капітал. Можливість оптом закупити велику партію товару дасть йому шанс зберегти час та зменшити витрати. Віталій планує купити повсякденний чоловічий та джинсовий жіночий одяг, розширити асортимент товарів напередодні літнього сезону. Він цінує доступність кредитних послуг в „Надії України”.

Together they successfully manage a little grocery kiosk at one of the local markets in Nikopol. Both Zachar and Ludmila have higher educations but instead of directly applying their schooling, they decided to become business owners. Their family also consists of a little boy whom they love and nurture. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;It has been Zachar and Ludmila’s desire to operate their business profitably and see it fully sustain their family. Today, they are seeing stability in their work and good returns. They would like to expend their grocery line in order to meet customer demand and generate additional profits. While both of them devote most of their time to their grocery kiosk, Ludmila has begun an additional business selling water filters. The couple is hopeful to see this venture take off in the future.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Through several years of partnering with “Nadiya Ukraine”, Zachar and Ludmila have proven themselves to be responsible, goal-oriented and hard-working entrepreneurs. Today, they are asking for a $1,000 loan to assist them in expanding the food items they have available in their busy grocery kiosk.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Захар з дружиною разом займаються бізнесом. В них є невеличкий кіоск з продажу харчів  на одному з місцевих ринків м. Нікополь. В Захара та Людмили є вища освіта, але їм більше до душі власний бізнес. Вони виховують маленького сина. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Захар та Людмила довго намагалися досягти прибутковості бізнесу, хотіли, щоб бізнес забезпечував усі потреби родини. Зараз їм вдалося досягти стабільності в торгівлі та підвищити власні доходи. На цьому етапі Захар і Людмила намагаються розширити асортимент товарів харчування, щоб задовольнити попит з боку покупців та отримати додатковий прибуток. Обидва наполегливо працюють для того, щоб досягти поставленої мети. До того ж Людмила почала займатися ще одним видом бізнесу, а саме продажем фільтрів для води. Подружжя сподівається, що цей бізнес буде не менш успішним ніж попередній. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Захар та Людмила співпрацюють з „Надією України” вже декілька останніх років. За цей час вони проявили себе як відповідальні, цілеспрямовані та працьовиті підприємці. Зараз вони просять про позику в 1000 доларів для того, щоб поповнити асортимент товарів харчування в своєму кіоску.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>27305</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To increase working capital </use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:59:16Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Zachar</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T05:47:26Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>334</amount><local_amount>334</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>334</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23617</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32740</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43350</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55296</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68073</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T05:47:26Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8514</id><name>Evgeniya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>If you’re a woman looking for shoes, clothing or something to decorate your home or dining room, make sure to stop by Evgeniya’s little store in Nikopol, Ukraine. She offers an attractive array of reasonably priced shoes, clothing, tablecloths and souvenirs. If she doesn’t have what you’re looking for, she can help you find someone who does.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Vendors like Evgeniya form the backbone of a prosperous market economy in Ukraine. These entrepreneurs have, often with little help, been able to start and sustain small businesses which provide enough income for them to live on. For many their goal is to expand by opening new kiosks or renting larger retail space. They may never be the size of Wal-Mart but they’ve started in much the same way. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Evgeniya has requested a six month loan for $500 which will give her some additional working funds for her business. She believes that God has blessed her through the financial help of “Nadiya Ukraine”. Thank you for being part of God’s blessing to the hard-working entrepreneurs of Ukraine.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Якщо ви шукаєте взуття, одяг, посуд або необхідні матеріали для декору інтер‘єру кухні, обов’язково зайдіть до невеличкої крамнички Євгенії в м. Нікополь. В неї ви знайдете різноманітний вибір взуття, одягу, скатертин та сувенірів за помірними цінами. Навіть якщо в неї ви не знайдете те, що шукаєте, Євгенія підкаже, де знайти того, хто зможе вам допомогти. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Саме такі підприємці, як Євгенія, сприяють процвітанню ринкової економіки України.  Ці бізнесмени відкрили власну справу, утрималися на плаву та отримали непоганий прибуток. Багато хто з них прагне розширити власний бізнес та відкрити нові кіоски або орендувати більші приміщення. Можливо, вони ніколи не досягнуть розмірів великих торгівельних центрів , але ж усі починають з малого. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Євгенія просить про позику в 500 доларів строком на 6 місяців, бо сподівається отримати додаткові кошти на розвиток власного бізнесу. Вона переконана, що Бог благословив її завдяки фінансовій підтримці від „Надії України”. Євгенія дякує вам за те, що ви стали частиною Божого благословення в житті старанних підприємців в Україні.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>27308</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Increase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Nikopol</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.566667 34.4</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:59:31Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Evgeniya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T23:19:57Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>168</amount><local_amount>168</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>168</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23618</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32741</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43351</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55297</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68074</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T23:19:57Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:52Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8515</id><name>Abla</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Abla has been a client of Kraban Support Foundation for years now.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Yuliya is married with an 18-year-old son. She has been a market vendor for many years and has gained rich experience in the business of selling women’s outerwear.   &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Yuliya has demonstrated consistency and integrity in working with “Nadiya Ukraine”. She has had no loan defaults since she took her first loan in 2003. Currently, Yuliya has about $2,000 of working capital. She re-stocks her inventory twice a month, buying from wholesalers, which helps to considerably reduce her transportation costs. Her monthly gross revenue amounts to $2,400, and her net profit is about $700.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Yuliya is requesting a loan for $800 to increase her working capital and re-supply her inventory before the spring season. She is planning to purchase an assortment of women’s clothing at wholesale prices for further retail sale. Yuliya believes that this loan will help boost her economic activity and allow her to generate more profits. It will not only help her grow her business, but will also provide better a quality of life for her and her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Юлія – одружена, в неї є 18-річний син. Вона торгує на ринку вже на протязі багатьох років. За цей період вона здобула багатий досвід в торгівлі жіночим верхнім одягом.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;В роботі з „Надією України” Юлія проявила себе як дуже послідовна та порядна людина. В неї не було жодного прострочення з того часу, як вона отримала свою першу позику в організації ще в 2003 році. Зараз в Юлії є приблизно 2000 доларів робочого капіталу. Вона робить закупки двічі на місяць на оптових базах, що допомагає їй значно знизити транспортні витрати. Її щомісячний валовий дохід складає приблизно 2400 доларів, чистий прибуток становить 700 доларів.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Юлія просить про позику в 800 доларів для того, щоб збільшити власний робочий капітал та поповнити запас товарів напередодні весняного сезону. Вона планує закупити асортимент жіночого одягу за оптовими цінами для подальшої роздрібної торгівлі. Юлія вважає, що позика сприятиме економічному зростанню її бізнесу та допоможе отримати додатковий прибуток. Фінансова допомога не тільки сприятиме росту торгівлі Юлії, але й забезпечить якісно краще життя для її родини.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>27318</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To increase on stock</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Berdyansk</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.716667 36.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:59:46Z</posted_date><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Yuliya</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T00:11:02Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>800</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>800</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>133.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>268</amount><local_amount>268</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:17:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>268</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23619</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:18:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32742</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:18:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43352</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>134</amount><local_amount>134</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:19:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>134</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55298</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68075</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T00:11:02Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:18:53Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8517</id><name>Ladger</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Ladger has been a client of Kraban Support Foundation for years now.

Most of her profit comes from selling dress shoes and shirts but her client base is larger because she also sells miscellaneous items that appeal to a broader demographic - including cosmetics, accessories, toys and personal care products.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This $400 loan will finance the expansion of her business - specifically purchasing more new clothing and shoes to increase sales. Plus, she will be able to afford better quality garments that can sell for a higher profit margin, which will give her more money to invest in savings and the needs of her children, on top of putting money back into her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Altagracia is one of Esperanza&apos;s special individual borrowers. She is still part of her Bank of Hope, which her group has named &apos;La Simpatía&apos;, but because of the success and size of her business, as well as her payment of previous loans, she is now eligible for larger, individual loan sizes.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>27354</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Heng Srey Mom has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T22:09:05Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T02:48:48Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8570</id><name>Khudoikul</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Khudoikul D. is a member of the group “Farz”.

She has three children and knows from her own experience that quality school supplies are necessary but hard to find at a reasonable price. Right now, the school season is almost over, and school bags are available wholesale at a lower price than usual. Zebi wants to buy the bags now so that she can start selling them in July and make a good profit. After doing the math, Zebi thinks that $800 is the right amount to invest.

He is married and has eight family members. He is a high school graduate, but during the wars he wasn&apos;t able to start his university. After marriage, his financial situation was not good, so he decided to start his own business. He borrowed money from his friends and established a small shop in which he sold limited grocery goods which he purchased from the market. His business continued that way for one year. Then he heard about the loan program from one of his relative. His first loan enabled him to offer more items for sale, and his business grow well. Noorullah has now finished his 4th loan cycle, and is ready to go on the the 5th cycle. He is pleased with the progress of his business and wants to continue with the loan program and keep developing his store.

She is single and lives in District 8 of Kabul City. She has studied up to secondary school after which her family didn&apos;t give her permission to study further. She wanted to complete her education and after that assist her family financially, but quiting education halted her dreams. Still, she didn&apos;t lose hope and started a shared business with her brother who runs a carpentry shop. At the start of her business she and her brother faced lots of problems because they didn&apos;t have enough money to purchase all the carpentry materials. Then she heard about AFSG&apos;s loan granting and she decided to take a loan for her business improvement. After the 1st and 2nd cycle she bought a carpentry machine which really helped them to operate more quickly in their business and increase their production. Now she is in her 4th loan cycle and wants to continue taking loans.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>28458</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Carpentry</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Buying

Chum V. has 4 children who all work--1 in a printing shop, and 3 that pack incense to be used at Buddhist ceremonies.  &lt;p&gt;With this loan Chum V. and her husband will buy a motorbike for their daughters to get to and from work.  It will save them money on transportation, and they would like to help their children since they all contribute to the household income.  In the future, Chum and her husband need to build up the land around the home in order to escape from flooding during the rainy season.  She also hopes to start her own tailoring business so she can provide jobs for her daughters once they are finished with

She is married and her family counts 6 people and lives in district 8 of Kabul. She is an illiterate women because when she was young girls were not allowed to go to school. She has a bead works business and through that she solves some of her financial problems. She started her business with limited resources and few materials because she didn&apos;t have enough money at that time to purchase more materials for her business. Therefore, her production was small and she could not make much income from her business. She was thinking about ways to expand her business when she heard about the loan process and decided to take a loan. She used her loans in a good way,  resulting in her business expanding, production increasing and sales improving. Sharifa has finished 3 loan cycles and now she is in her 4th cycle. She is happy with the loans and wants to continue with it because the loans had a positive impact in her business.

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Pharm Tihiv has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T21:05:06Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T02:37:16Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8586</id><name>Noorullah</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Noorllah was born in 1982, lives in district 8 of Kabul, and is married.

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Chea Rotha has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T05:37:47Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T02:27:00Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8588</id><name>Khiev</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Khiev N. sells perfume at the local market in Phnom Penh.

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Khiev Nary has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T22:42:17Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T03:15:13Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8589</id><name>Kuch</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Kuch S. is 46 years old and works 3 jobs--she is a teacher, a grocer, and a kitchenware saleswoman.

Together they have four children and live in the regional center of Orhei.  Ruslan has been worried for some time about not being able to provide for his family and realized the only way to make a sustainable future for his family was to start his own business.  Ruslan comes from an agricultural background yet he has no land to start a farm.  After studying different possibilities he has decided to start growing mushrooms.  Growing mushrooms requires very little land and the initial investment is reasonable which makes it an ideal micro business startup for any entrepreneur. Ruslan decided to start growing mushrooms in his cellar of his house where all the conditions necessary to grow mushrooms (ventilation of air, humidity control and temperature) are easily maintained.  Ruslan will sell his mushrooms at the local market or to wholesalers in bulk quantities where there is a market for roughly 10-15 Kilograms per day of mushrooms.  To develop his business, Ruslan needs a loan to procure high quality spores, specific bags for growing mushrooms and to make repairs to a ventilation system.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>28509</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

Kiva Lender,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Great news! Cheng Sokry has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn’t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn’t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn’t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the upside, the issue occurred because the client’s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client’s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Best regards,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia&#13;&#10;Mr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia&#13;&#10;</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T07:37:10Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-03-04T02:42:20Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8598</id><name>Roth</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. Roth P. is 40 years old and lives in Phnom Penh with his wife, Leng Vichet.

She is married, has 8 family members, and right now lives in district 8 of Kabul City. She has a tailoring business and wants to take a loan for that. She is an uneducated woman because her family didn’t give her permission to study. However, she wanted to do something for her family, especially after her marriage, and that is why she started her tailoring business. She makes clothes and sells them in bazaar. When she first started her business, she didn’t have enough money. Therefore, her production was small, and she made little money. Then she heard about the loan process through AFSG from one of her friends, and she decided to start taking loans. Up to now she has taken 3 loan cycles from AFSG and wants to take a 4th cycle. Now her business has expanded, and she is making more clothes. As a result, her income has increased.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>28532</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Buying
