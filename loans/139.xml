He is married and has two children.  One of his children is working and the other is still in school. Sam enjoys operating his business and is motivated to work hard because he dreams of a better future for his kids. He owns and operates a &quot;drinking spot&quot; and sells items such as canned drinks, alcoholic beverages etc. However, he is constrained by the lack of capital and is unable to make meaningful progress. He requests the loan to buy more crates of beer, canned malt, Pepsi and Coke so that he can earn increased profits. He also believes in maintaining good customer relations.  The loan will enable him to materialize his dream. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He is a member of the community group named &quot;Hyebenehi&quot; Trust Group.  In this group, members guarantee and assist one another to repaying their loans. His picture was taken after one of the group

He is married and has three children. Qudrat is a hard-working man who, while continuing to work another job, started his own business as a source of additional income. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Qudrat works as tractor driver, but his profession brings him money only once a year, in the autumn when it is harvest season. At all other times, he is unemployed, and this cycle motivated him to start his cattle breeding business in 2001. With time, he has increased his sales and now he needs assistance for investing in his business. The business has been going well and he would like it to continue to grow. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Qudrat applied for a loan of $1200 USD to buy four calves. With the profit from this loan, he wants to support his children with their education. He and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in continuing this business and helping them give their children a better quality of life.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>212779</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

She is a manufacturer of palm kernel oil, which is a by-product of the production of palm oil and is commonly used in fried dishes with fish and pastries.  Although Faustina&apos;s palm kernel oil is in high demand by local food vendors, her productivity is low but she has been unable to mechanize her production due to her poverty.  To overcome this problem, and to increase her profits so that she can put her other children through school, Faustina has joined the Mawulehand Trust Group, which helps its members secure financing by having them guaranteeing one another&apos;s loans.

Altogether, he has been in this business for six years, and, because of his polite attitude, he has managed to establish a large group of loyal customers. Shahin would like to further expand his business and to increase the variety of products that he offers. Therefore, he needs a loan of US$1,200 for a term of 15 months to be able to purchase a variety of additional foodstuffs for sale.

She grows vegetables and sells them to the market, earning approximately US$2.16 per day. She is married with four children, all of whom are students. Ret faces difficulty with insects that ravage her vegetable crop. With this problem, Ret asks for a loan of US$250 to buy insecticide to protect her vegetable crop and to buy more seeds to use for cyclic growing. The loan will allow her to increase her family&apos;s income. Ret is the leader of the small group of three members, joined below: &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;1. Mrs. Leab M., 51, widowed, grows and sells vegetable. Leab requests a loan of US$200 to purchase insecticide to use for her vegetable crop. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;2. Mr. Sary V., 28, makes and sells charcoal from his house. Sary requests a loan of US$200 to pay for farmland plowing of growing rice. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;3.

Village in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Doeur S. is the village bank president. She owns a small grocery store in the local market. Since her business is going well, she decided to ask for a loan to buy more grocery products for her inventory in order to meet her customers&apos; demands. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband, Mr. Tuy Phearun, is a motorbike taxi-driver who makes a small income to support his family. Mrs. Doeur S. is 26 years old and the mother of two children, one of whom is attending the local school. The youngest one, age four, is too young to work or study. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. Members with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1725</funded_amount><paid_amount>1725</paid_amount><image><id>212858</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

Sok Yin&apos;s Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Sixteen people in Trapeang Anchan Village in Kampong Chhnang Province have formed a village bank loan group. Each member plans to use the loan for a different purpose. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. S. Y., the village bank president, owns a small store where she sells rice soup to villagers and passers-by. Her business is going well and she wants to expand it, so she has decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice and other ingredients used to cook delicious rice soup for her customers. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband, Mr. Phin Veoun, has a plot of land where he cultivates rice for a living. Mrs. S. Y. is 43 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory. The others are attending the local school. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One of the members of this village loan group has an end-of-term loan. The rest have monthly payment loans. The member with the end-of-term loan is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. The terms allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>2225</funded_amount><paid_amount>2225</paid_amount><image><id>212859</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

Because of growing customer demand, he needs to increase his inventory of boards. A loan of US$50 will allow him to purchase more gasoline to use in his machine to increase his productivity.

Living in Kampong Cham, she is able to make around US$4 each day of profit. Her fish come from her husband who is a fisherman. Even though her husband is a fisherman, they need to purchase fish from other fisherman because her husband may not catch enough for resale at the market. The couple has one son who is employed as a car driver with a salary of US$150 each month.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Inflation has played a huge role in the society. The domestic price of rice and fertilizer has doubled over the past year, while the price of meat and fish has increased 30 to 60 percent, according to the government report. This factor was caused by inflation. Most of the employed people get the same pay, while prices keep increasing.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ly K. is requesting a loan of US$1000 to purchase a wooden boat, a motor and other fishing nets for her husband to catch more fish for resale. These items will cost around US$600. The remaining funds will be used to open another business and help double the family income.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>212909</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

Living in Kampong Cham, she typically makes US$3 each day selling many kinds of vegetables from house to house in the village. Her husband, Sam Mao, 26, earns around US$3 from a recycling business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Even though the couple has an income, it is still hard as the current inflation figure hit a record of 24 percent. Most of the employed workers still get the same pay as before except for a few workers, but now have higher costs. Some said  inflation has the worst effect on farmers and poor people. The domestic price of rice and fertilizer has doubled over the past year, while the price of meat and fish has increased 30 to 60 percent, according to the government report. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Some P. is requesting a loan of US$350 to purchase a motorbike for her husband to easily transport his recycling items.

She sells groceries, making about US$5 of profit each day. Selling groceries has been hard since inflation keeps increasing. It brings the price of goods to unreasonable levels. The report from ADB to the government says that the domestic price of rice and fertilizer has doubled over the past year, while the price of meat and fish has increased 30 to 60 percent. It is a huge concern to every class of people, especially farmers and poor people. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Tem said that since her husband&apos;s death, she faces difficulties meeting daily expenses and she needs to take care her two school-aged children. Her education costs for her children are less than they will be in the future and she must work hard and save money for them to continue with their education. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Tem N. has requested a loan of US$500 to plant yams to help increase the family&apos;s income.

It is hard for farmers to depend on precipitation and they have to own a water pump in case their fields go without rain water. Normally, people grow rice two times a year. Certain kinds of rice seeds grow during the dry season and it takes 3-4 months until harvest time. The other kinds of rice seeds grow in the rainy season and take about 6-7 months until harvest. Rice farmers prefer rice that grows in the rainy season because it has a better flavor. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her husband, Hoeun Chet, 37, sells palm leaves.

Since 1979, she has been growing rice but her output is just to enough to pay her family&apos;s living expenses. Her husband works in construction, making around US$2.5 each per day. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her rice crops have been less than adequate due to various reasons. The weather conditions are difficult and farmers that cannot afford a water pump or have no ability to access water, will face crop damage. Inflation has skyrocketed the price of goods-- domestic prices of rice and fertilizers have doubled and the price of meat and fish have increased 30-60 percent.  Inflation has hit a record of 23 percent.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Eam Y. is asking for a loan of US$300 to purchase palm leaves for resale. She will buy the leaves from the palm climber and continue to sell at the market.

The price of rice has doubled over the past year as have the fertilizers for the fields. When the weather is reliable, Sem can count on a good inventory. Her husband, Dong Ban, 41, works at collecting palm juice and refines it to sugar palm for sale. He is able to make US$3 each day. The couple has five children; two are construction workers; one is a student and the others are of pre-school age. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Sem S. would like to take out a loan of US$800 to

She and her husband are farmers who typically make about US$2 each day and are supported by two children working in the casino building. The weather conditions have been difficult for farming in Cambodia this past year, and inflation has also been out of control. These factors have played into a difficult economic year for many Cambodians, Chan K. included. She is asking for a loan of US$800 to make two investments. First, she will spend US$300 to purchase a water pump, and second, she will spend the rest of the money to purchase another plot of farmland to expand her plantation. She is confident that this loan will allow her to increase her daily income and to better support her family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>212949</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

They are her inspiration to work hard every day and continue with her business. When her husband passed away, Dilbar was left without steady income. Supporting her children practically on her own was very difficult. After a long suffering she decided to open a grocery store near her house. Considering that Dilbar is the only owner of the grocery store in her community her business went well after it started. Dilbar is trying to generate income not only for her family&apos;s consumption but also to be able to create savings for the dowries of her daughters and future weddings of all of her children. Today Dilbar is planning to increase the range of her selling goods. With this purpose she requests 2800 Somoni ($825 USD) for the term of 12 months. Support this woman of much strength and courage to keep working. Your generosity can change her and her familyl&apos;s

She is a garment factory worker and typically makes US$2 each day, while her husband, Nith Sean, 27, is a motor-taxi driver, earning around US$2.50 each day as well. He sometimes also acts as a construction worker building houses. Inflation has put the motor-taxi driver off the road; right now everyone make less because of the high price of gas. The government recently issued a report saying that the domestic prices of rice and fertilizer have doubled over the past year, while the price of meat and fish has increased 30 to 60 percent.

Mahmud has always opted to make his life in his land, and work hard and grow with it. That is how he decided to rear cows and dedicate himself to agriculture. He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time, as he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background, and now he is in charge of handing down all that experience to his children. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Today, he wishes to increase the number of his cattle and he would like to buy cows with the hope of increasing his income and the well-being of his home with the innumerable benefits that these special little animals provide him. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 3500 Somoni (US$1050) for the term of 12 months.

Abduzoir is an entrepreneurial cattleman who is married and has four children. He yearns to make his small business into a big family business so that he can improve the quality of life for his wife and children. He currently has three cows and a calf. He grows his own feed for them in order to improve the quality of the milk they produce. His desire to grow his business has led him to improve his production techniques, so that he can distribute the milk to his clients in a timely manner.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Abduzoir wants to buy additional cows to increase the amount of milk and gradually establish a store in his house where he will sell high-quality dairy products. To do this, Abduzoir is requesting a loan of 3000 Somoni ($900 USD), which he is committed to repaying over a period of 12 months. With your help, Abduzoir will be able to buy additonal cows and improve the cattle’s feed. Let’s work together so that Abduzoir can make his dream a reality.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>900</funded_amount><paid_amount>900</paid_amount><image><id>212958</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>To

He accomplishes this by means of caring for his animals on a daily basis. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He clearly remembers the time when he decided to become independent, with a small number of animals and a small patch of land. When he got married, he only owned a few number of cattle, and now, thanks to his efforts and dedication, he owns two cows to fatten and sell at the local market. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He holds great hopes for the present time of year because it is high season for wedding parties and meat is a very popular item for the celebrations. For this purpose, Mubariz has applied for a loan of US$1200 in order to purchase one cow and two calves. Your generosity can change this family&apos;s lives.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>212965</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>to

Because the small pension he received was not sufficient to cover the family&apos;s basic expenses, he decided to start his own business selling office supplies, beverages, snacks and candies. He made a wise decision when he rented a place near one of the local schools and now the majority of his clients are school children, teachers and sometimes parents. &#13;&#10; &#13;&#10;Asad tries to give his family as much money as possible in order to cover the expenses of schooling his grandchildren. His sons are married but it is still very hard to cover family needs and Asad`s business is an additional source of income.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Today Asad wants to expand his business and to increase his working capital in order to purchase new goods to sell. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of US$1200. He hopes you will choose to play an important role in his business&apos; growth and in the life of his family, and he thanks you for your support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>212968</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She has a business in selling food products (sweets, sugar and jams, etc). Mrs. K. works in a bazaar where she has a wide assortment of goods and many permanent clients.

daily bread. He is a widower with one son. He has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of food products such as sweets, soft drinks, juices, and other items. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He began running his food store nine years ago in order to support his parents, and he is their only support. Today he needs to buy additional products to increase the range of goods he sells. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of US$1200.  He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while, to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>212981</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Ever since he was very young, Sulaymonkul has raised and sold cattle, work that he learned from his humble parents. With experience gained over time in the purchase and sales of cattle he has been able to bring stability to his family. The desire that Sulaymonkul harbors in his heart is to aquire more animals so he can increase his income. Above all, he hopes to offer a better quality of life for his beloved grandchildren, who always support him unconditionally in his daily work. He requests a loan of 3000 Somoni ($900 USD) for the term of 12 months. Let’s get together behind the request of this devoted father and

Nazir began earning income selling seasonal vegetables when he was 17 years old by helping his dad. After a while, he began working at other jobs, but realized that his work wasn&apos;t bringing in enough income to cover the expenses of his family. Therefore, Nazir decided to independently re-engage in the seasonal vegetable sales business. Gradually, he is becoming known in the area, however, he still needs additional capital to purchase vegetables for sale, given the high demand during the current season. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nazir is asking for a loan of US$1200 to buy additional vegetables for sale and thus earn more profit. Nazir plans to use the additional income to help his children move forward in completing their studies. He is thankful to everyone for their support.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>212992</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

(shown in the picture with his family), and his wife, Mrs. Srey Khun, live in a small village across the Mekong River, about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh. The couple was married in 1986 and have six children - five sons and one daughter. The first son has a full-time job while the other three sons study in a local school and the two youngest stay at home. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Khunthea has been producing concrete posts (for building fences) and concrete pipes (for using in sewage systems) for the past ten years. He buys cement and steel then sells these to villagers. Ms. Srey has been selling banana grills in front of the local school for thirteen years now.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kunthea is requesting a loan of $1000 to purchase cement and steel to build concrete

His main goal now is to help his parents financially. Since 2003, he has been selling cell phones. Business is very good, and Iftihar needs to increase his inventory of phones to meet the needs of his clients. To do this, he is applying for a loan of $1200 USD. Because he is a young businessman and this is his first loan, Iftihar is especially grateful to everyone who chooses to support him and promises to repay the loan

She is married and the loving mother of three children. She started her own business 10 years ago because her husband&apos;s salary was not enough for their family expenses. Amaliya is a market entrepreneur from Imishli city. She runs a stall selling candies, sweets, eggs, sugar, salt, cookies, conserves, etc. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Amaliya is respectful and patient with all of her customers which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amaliya is seeking to keep her business be more sustainable and has requested a loan of $1200 USD for the term of 15 months to increase the inventory she has for sale. One of her plans for the future is to open a new vending facility. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Amaliya reach all of her

She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in Dushanbe city. Salomat works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and a very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabric vendors in the market where she works. She is very persistant and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 5 years. Salomat is a skilled entrepreneur – when she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Salomat has obviously been a successful small business entrepreneur. However, she doesn’t want to stop. She would like to continue seeing her venture grow. Today she is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1200 USD) for 12 months to increase her assorted inventory and possibly open a new vending location in the future. Salomat is counting on your help.

He stays in Ruai town, on the outskirts of Nairobi. Bernard also takes care of his father aged 90 years; who needs constant special care since he is bed ridden and has to have somebody by his side always. Bernard makes sure that the helper he has employed is always by his fathers&apos; side so that he can feed and bathe him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bernard story is of sheer determination. In the year 1967, Bernard was employed in a hotel in Sagana a town in Central Kenya where he was paid Ksh 20 per month and he used to save Ksh 10 per month. His employer raised his salary to Ksh 100 per month. True to his determination he saved enough money and by the year 1988 and with an initial capital of Ksh 30,000.&#13;&#10;Bernard with other businessmen from Central province relocated to Nairobi the capital city. Here they selling clothes which they usually got after sending one of them to neighboring Tanzania, this continued until 1989 when they decided to part ways, and everybody started operating individually.&#13;&#10;During this year conflict of trade between the two countries made Bernard to opt to operate from Kenya by starting to sell second hand clothes from one of the biggest second hand markets in Kenya named Gikomba Market. This he did by acquiring a &#13;&#10;Stall, he started with 3 bales of clothes. Business is usually good since many people like the second hand clothes since they are cheap, some going for as less than a dollar per piece.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bernard also combines his cloth selling business with the sale of fruits, and since these are seasonal he reaps profits from the sale of them.&#13;&#10; Bernard suffered a set- back in his business last year December when Kenya experienced the post election violence, all his stock of clothes were stolen and the rest was burnt by the youths. Bernard was so distressed and to be hospitalized for three weeks after which he got counseling, he ahs been selling pine- apples at his former stall and he still hopes he will open his stall again. During this period, Bernard was directed to come to the Action Now Offices so that they can see how to help him after he came to our offices. We foundries case worth sanding to Kiva lenders.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10; Bernard is kindly requesting Ksh 40,000 from Kiva lenders. This will enable him; purchase 5 bales of second hand clothes. The repayment period for this loan is  14 months.</en></texts></description><status>deleted</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><image><id>213013</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase bales of clothes</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Ruai, Nairobi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>36</partner_id><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Bernard</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_amount>40000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments/><scheduled_payments/><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments/><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69291</id><name>Zulfiya</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Zulfiya G. is 41 years old.

Asma baji wants a loan to buy baking supplies (bread, butter and eggs) to resell. Muniran baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her shop. Martha baji wants a loan to buy crystal and handmade decorative pieces to resell. Mahnaz baji wants a loan to buy spare parts for her workshop. Razia baji wants a loan to buy construction supplies for her business. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is a group loan.

He was a very successful business man in Kabala before rebels looted his shop, where he sold bags of cement and rice. His family supplied him with the initial capital necessary to start with the new meat and soft drink business. The business is growing, but at a very slow pace.  He thus came to SMT to seek a loan of Le 3,500,000.00 to enable him to re-enter the business of selling cement and

Damba is 35, and she was born in Senyedugu about 3 miles from Kabala. She is currently living and doing her business in Kabala, where she is married to a business man who sells kola-nuts. The two have one child who is now a tailor. She also fosters two of her brother&apos;s children. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Damba is requesting a loan of Le 3,500,000.00 to help her expand her current business. Damba&apos;s business is seasonal and dependent on the price and availability of products from other regions. She sells items like beans, bitter-kula (a popular non-tobacco chew), rice, palm-oil, ground-nuts, and many more. Most of these items she buys from villages surrounding Kabala town, including Frawa, Gbrafe, and Gbabukoro. She then takes the goods to Freetown, where she sells them. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Damba&apos;s immediate goal is to be able to make more profit to raise funds to build herself a house - a house where she can sleep well, with peace of mind for herself and

I sell popular consumer products. I have had my business for 5 years. The business has a lot of demand because it is located in a very popular area. My clients are people with limited resources, and I prefer them because I sell at an accessible price for all of my clients. At this time, I need to supply my business more, and I need a loan to be able to stock my grocery store with many products, since my clients have many demands. Thanks to this business, I have taken my children forward in their education and nutrition. Also, I don’t neglect them because my business is located in my home. In this way, I take care of my children. I want to go forward to have a better income and to be able to improve the quality of my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva

Every member of this group of 15 is applying for their 7th loan! Each member took out their first loan from Esperanza International having virtually nothing. Now, going on their 7th loan, each member has had success with their very own business. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Antonia A. is the chosen group representative and has proven to be a great leader and a blessing to the group. She is a very hardworking woman who is very diligent in everything she does. She is the mother of 5 children, and they were the reason she took out her first loan. She has always wanted to provide a good life for her family, and for the first time in her life she is starting to be able to provide for them. She looks for this next loan to increase her business and to continue to grow. She dreams of being able to travel and having her own thriving food market someday. On behalf of Antonia, the rest of the group, and Esperanza International: Thank you for your

This is not only because she is a single mother of three daughters and one son, but also because she has had to care for her disabled daughter and offer room in her rented house in Huaraz to students as a means of supporting herself.  She also provides child-care services.

By starting the business he was able to earn income to sustain his family. He began in October of 1988, and has nearly 20 years of experience in this business. He first started driving a minivan on a fixed route, and later bought his own vehicle in order to work for himself. This was inconvenient because he had to rent the license plates, but fortunately he now has his own franchise and a new model car. Thanks to God the business has done well and Jorge likes his work because he gets to set his own schedule.

She learned to bake many years ago because it is her family trade. She began to bake and sell bread 20 years ago, when her family had an established bakery. It was closed two years ago because her father was getting old and couldn&apos;t work. This was when Margarita decided to bake bread in her home and sell it door to door. She likes this work and the business has gone well. Margarita has many clients.

Her husband had passed away and Juana was left with the responsibility for her children. She looked for various alternatives to earn money and this was the best way to accommodate her needs, because she can also care for her children while she works. This is a better life, and Juana enjoys sales. First Juana began washing and ironing clothing and cleaning the houses of her neighbors, plus a couple of other activities that combined, earned enough income to support her children. In April 2002 Juana began to sell used clothing when her son, who lives in the U.S., sent her boxes of used clothing. She sold them, and was able to support her other children and help her grandchildren. Thanks to a previous loan with Kiva, Juana could buy more boxes of clothing. Now she&apos;d like to buy used clothing for autumn and winter. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Juana needs a loan of US $400, which she&apos;ll repay in 5 months. She&apos;ll use the money to buy more boxes of clothing so as to offer better supplies to her clients and increase her sales and income. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>213229</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Buy merchandise</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-17T11:50:12Z</posted_date><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Juana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-10-31T14:44:58Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>5000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-31T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-31T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-31T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1000</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>80</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-11-30T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-17T09:07:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1046.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>5279983</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-21T08:55:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1046.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9891772</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-31T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-24T08:50:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1046.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14815002</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-28T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T07:54:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1046.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20349807</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>1000</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-31T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T09:02:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1046.93</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27037093</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-17T14:44:58Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-04-15T09:02:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69373</id><name>Virgen De Guadalupe</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>La señora Guadalupe pertenece al Banco Comunal “La Amistad”, ubicado en la Calle Oroya  Mz.10 Lt.07, del Distrito de Callería del Departamento de Ucayali.

Comenzó en Agosto de 1992, primero  vendiendo cerámica que una señora le daba a comisión para que  la vendiera. Como se dio cuenta que era un buen negocio decidio independizarse y sus ganancias  se duplicaron. Además de la cerámica también comenzó a vender productos de belleza y sus ganancias también eran buenas, posteriormente se dedicó a vender joyería y actualmente se dedica a la venta de ropa. El anterior crédito que recibío a través de KIVA le sirvió muchísimo ya que pudo resurtir su negocio para la temporada de fin de año que es cuando las personas compran más.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ella necesita un prestamo por US $550 que pagara en  5 meses para volver a surtir el negocio para darle un mejor servicio a los clientes y para que estos le sigan comprando</es><en>Rosa started her business because she&apos;s always liked sales. Her business gives Rosa the opportunity to get to know other people, be independent, earn her own money, help her children pursue professional careers, and have a better quality of life. She started in August of 1992, first selling ceramics that she commissioned from a lady who crafts them. When she realized that business was good, she decided to work independently and her sales doubled. In addition to ceramics, she also began to sell beauty products, and later she added jewelry. Now she sells clothing, too. Rosa&apos;s previous loan with Kiva helped her a lot because she was able to resupply her business for the holiday season, when people spend more.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Rosa needs a loan of US$550, which she&apos;ll repay in 5 months. She&apos;ll once again use the money to supply her business so as to provide better service to her customers so that they continue to buy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>213232</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Used Clothing</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Buy merchandise</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-19T20:10:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Rosa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-02T23:01:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>MXN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>7000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1400</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>1400</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>110</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>110</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>110</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>110</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>110</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-17T09:07:43Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1439.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9891773</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-21T08:56:00Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1439.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14815003</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-15T08:15:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1439.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20349808</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T08:58:36Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1439.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27037094</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>1400</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T09:35:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1439.53</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35927521</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-19T22:01:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-05-15T09:35:22Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69375</id><name>Teresa De Jesus</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>La señora Teresa pertenece al Banco Comunal “La Amistad”, ubicado en el Jr. Oroya Mz.G Lt. 2, AA.HH.

Mejorada in the district of Mariscal Cáceres in Huancavelica. Situated on the right bank of the Mantaro River, at an altituD. of between 2600 and 3600, the community has a mild climate and can be accessed from the towns of Huancavelica and Huancayo by both rail and road. Farming (cereal crops, potatoes, beans, vegetables); animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, and young animals); as well as commerce and tourism are the main activities. &#13;&#10;Teresa A. is married and has eight children. She began her business 8 years ago with a small amount of capital, but because of health problems, she lost everything. She began selling meals and opened a small store that she still runs. With the loan that she receives, she plans to increase her stock. Now she not only sells from her store but also from a stall that she has in a school. Her dream is to see her children become professionals, especially her four youngest children as the older ones are married and she does not have the means to have them study.&#13;&#10;Paulina S. is married and has five children. She started work with FINCA six months ago when she invested her first loan in the purchase of guinea pigs and chickens. Beforehand she could not sell anything because no one would lend her money, whereas now she buys and sells young animals. She has succeeded in increasing her income and now has no problems putting bread on the table. Her dream is to save enough to buy a plot of land so she can live there with her mother-in-law.&#13;&#10;Saturnina F. is married and has four children. In the past she used to wash clothes for a living, but now she sells anticuchos (type of kebab) and fried foods. She used to have problems with her husband because he drank too much, but now he has work, and so she has been able to overcome her difficulties. With the loan she has managed to buy a kebab stand, and now she earns more than before and has more money to spend on her children. Saturnina’s plan is to save money so that her children can lead happy lives and lack for nothing—especially where their education is concerned.&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated

He works a 24 hour shift and has the following day off but takes advantage of his day off by working in construction because his salary is not very high.  The extra work is helpful as his goal is to finish building his home.  Joel is requesting this loan to improve the infrastructure of his home since it is currently made of wood and zinc.  His wish is to live better and to enjoy a home that is worthy of his family.  He will only use the loan to purchase construction materials such as rock, sand, cement and iron as he will provide the labor himself.

His wife is a dressmaker, and they have three children—ages 8, 12, and 14—all of them in school.  Ever is the head waiter at a restaurant where he has worked for 8 years.  He arrives home late each night, since the restaurant is busiest at night—some nights Ever comes home feeling inspired because of the tips that his customers have given him, while on other nights he feels tired from the long hours.  With the loan he has requested Ever would like to install a sewer system and purchase two doors for his house so that his family can have a safer and more hygienic home.  His long-term goal is to be in a situation where he can continue improving his house, have his own business and be able to help his children with their studies.&lt;br

He is married and has two children ages 23 and 25 both of whom are independent.  His wife is a merchant and she gets up in the mornings to prepare breakfast for her husband who has to get ready for work early as he works as a taxi driver and needs to check his car before leaving.  He has been in this business for fourteen years and the job can sometimes be tiring because the situation is bad and clients do not want to pay what the trips are worth.  However, there are good days.  He started his business by buying his car with his own funds.  He is asking for this loan to buy construction materials such as sand, cement, iron, and zinc to build an addition to the back of his home.

She has two children ages two and 18 years old.  Her oldest child is in school.  Her husband is a construction worker who works independently and is also sometimes contracted.  Veronica has worked as a domestic worker for over 20 years for different families.  She was given the opportunity to work as a domestic worker when she was a single mother who had been abandoned by her husband.  She had to pay for the necessities and this work has, until this day, allowed her to support her family.  Luckily she remarried and she now has a family.  This loan will be used to repair the infrastructure of her home.  She wants to change the roof of her home which is in bad shape and is in need of repair because it leaks.  Her long term goal is to have her own business and be able to stay at home and to help her children with their studies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Manzo, Kiva

He travels to diverse places like a missionary, teaching the Bible.  He does this without neglecting his activities as a farmer and, thanks to the aid of his wife, he can carry out his multiple tasks.  Demetrio travels constantly, but the great majority of the days of the month he spends with his family in his fields.  We find them on the outskirts of his home, extending the coffee crop.  He hopes that the prices of coffee will improve so that he can obtain better profits.  Similarly, he hopes to increase his production and for this, he requests this loan. He will invest in his coffee plantations, so that, with the improvement of his income, he can have the opportunity to offer higher education to his three daughters and also to continue travelling carrying the word of God to the people.  We hope that you can offer him the necessary support to do well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva

Her oldest son goes to school so she has to get him ready so that her husband can drop him off at school since Yesenia has to attend to her business.  Yesenia has a grocery store and she sells quite a bit in the mornings.  Yesenia established her store four years ago with the help of her husband.  She is asking for this loan to purchase daily supplies so that she can offer her clients a variety of products in order to increase her sales.  This is the fourth loan that she has received from this institution and with this help she has been able to increase the stock in her store.

However, the diverse needs of his family led him to work in other activities.  With much effort, and after several years of working his farm, he was able to acquire a motocar which he uses to transport customers in the afternoons and evenings.  Thanks to these activities, he can provide for his home and – importantly – give his six children the opportunity to become educated.  He tells us he hopes they can live better than their father.  However, despite his two endeavors, there have been months when things have not gone well due to the various maintenance issues related to his motocar which create difficulties for him in improving his income.

The owners of the ranch provide their workers with housing. He, along with other people, spend all day cultivating their assigned fields, as well as picking crops and loading them on to trucks headed to the capital and to different cities in the country. Nevertheless, Fabian aspires to start his own crop business. Thanks to his work, he was able to obtain a plot of land for cultivation. In addition to his job at the ranch, Mr. Fabian, with the help of his spouse, works growing potatoes.

Because of health problems, he cannot do his work as a farmer.  Nevertheless, he managed to establish a business within his community.  Owing to the large demand for food establishments, he set up a small restaurant, a meeting spot for various inhabitants who are grateful to Mr. Modesto for the business, which serves to strengthen bonds of friendship and camaraderie among the neighbors.  Now Mr. Modesto wants his business to be more welcoming and for this he wants to adapt it so that people can sit comfortably and feel at home with the restaurant service.

She is a farmer but her farming is just to support her family members. Previously, she said she could sell some rice but currently, she cannot because of inflation and bad weather conditions. She said the rice and fertilizers prices have doubled in the past year; this means that she needs to pay double the prices for fertilizers for her rice field but still gets the same amount as before. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She grows rice two times a year. First, during the dry season, harvesting the rice takes about 3-4 months. During the rainy season, harvesting takes about 6-7 months. Rich people prefer rice that grows during the rainy season because it tastes more flavorful.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She still received support from three of her children, two of whom are garment workers and one is a sand pump worker. Her husband is a worker and makes around US$4 each day. Vann K. would like to take out a loan of US$300 to purchase good bean seeds to grow. This will help increase the family

She sells many kinds of products including cake, candy, soft drinks, and food ingredients in front of one school in her village and earns around US$1.66 per day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband, Mr. Ly Kong, is construction worker, earning around US$2.00 per day. Sophy has four children, some of whom are students and stay at home to help generate family&apos;s income. Two of her children are garment workers who earn US$4 per day. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sophy and her husband work hard everyday in order to support family daily expenses. Grocery selling business is the main income for family so she needs to update her business through increasing additional inventories to satisfy her customers&apos; demand. She faces obstacles of lacking enough money to carry out her plan. Hence, Sophy would like to request a loan of US$300 to purchase more grocery inventory. Her future plan includes purchasing a store in the market for her daughter to sell vegetables.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>213319</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

yang masih duduk di bagku pendidikan SMP. Penghasilan suaminya sebagai seorang petani yang tidak menentu membuat NI Ketut Semadi kesulitan dalam membiayai anaknya yang masih sekolah, belum lagi di tambah kebutuhan hidup keluarganya yang semakin hari semakin meningkat. Untuk menunjang kebutuhan hidup keluarganya maka  Ni Ketut Semadi memilih untuk beternak babi. Melalui program ternak babi yang dikelola oleh Dinari, Ni ketut Semadi mendapat pembinaan dan pinjaman modal usaha sebesar Rp. 5.000.000,- dengan jangka waktu pinjaman selama 6 bulan yang mana  pembayarannya dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman, membuat Ni Ketut Semadi lebih bersemangat lagi untuk bisa mengembangkan usaha ternak babinya. Pinjaman yang diperoleh tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan yang akan di peliharanya dalam jangka waktu 5 bulan. Biasanya dalam satu periode pemeliharaan Ni Ketut Semadi mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 300.000,- per ekor. Melalui pendampingan dari Dinari saat ini, Ni Ketut Semadi berharap pada akhir periode nanti dia bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih besar dari kenuntungan yang didapat sebelumnya.</id><en>Ni Ketut Semadi loves in Tukadaya village with her husband and her child that is currently studying in junior high school.

Besides vegetable growing she also makes Khmer food to sell in her village. She has been running the business since 1980 and earns around $3 per day. Koeurn is married with three children, and all her children live at home and attend school. Her husband, Mr. Nhanh Sem, is a construction worker who earns around $3 per day for the family. Because of the increasing cost of transportation for her family, Koeurn would like to have a motorcycle to help reduce costs and make it easier to quickly transport her vegetable crop to sell in the market. However, Koeurn lacks the money to carry out her plan. In this situation, she has requested a loan of $1,050 to purchase a motorcycle and also a pump machine to use for her vegetable growing. For her future plan, she aims to have a large farm to grow vegetables.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1050</funded_amount><paid_amount>1050</paid_amount><image><id>213340</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

He is educated. He is one of the staff of the National Bank of Afghanistan. He has been involved in this business for more than 8 years but he lives in a rental house. With his salary he can support his family and pay the rent of his house, but he can&apos;t build a house or buy a house. A few years ago, he bought land but he was unable to build  on it. Now he needs a loan to build a house and go to live in his own house.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Therefore he has requested an individual loan of 50000 Afghanis with a term of 18 months to start working on his land to build his new home and start a new life to help with his family better than now and make a bright future for his family.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ashraf is happy with all parts of his family. He would like to say that it is really a big help for Ashraf. He wants to say that without this loan it would be impossible for him to undertake the work on his house. Finally, he would like to thank lenders around the world.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>213355</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

First he had a restaurant  in Parwoan province, then when he came back to Kabul, he opened a restaurant in Kabul. He has 10 employees in his restaurant. Its location is very good but the restaurant  is smaller than other restaurants  with lots of customers in the area. He would like to expand his restaurant.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Therefore he wants to take out an individual loan of 50000 Afghanis with a term of 12 months to start working on enlarging his restaurant,  to expand his business and help his family, especially his sons who are not married yet.&#13;&#10;&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;He is happy with this loan process in Afghanistan and he has requested from all workers who use a loan and make a good business for themselves.

He has been driving a taxi since 2004 and can earn approximately $2.33 per day. His wife, Mrs. Eoeun Met, 37, buys raw materials and makes Khmer traditional baskets to sell from her house. Phon has four children, all of whom go to school and also help with their mother&apos;s business. Phon faces difficulty with his old motorcycle, which is often broken, depriving him of customers and thus affecting his income. He needs a new motorcycle to improve his income, but he lacks the money to carry out this plan. Hence, he has requested a loan of $200 to purchase a secondhand motorcycle to replace the old one.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Phon was chosen as the leader of a five-member loan group. The other members are:&lt;P&gt; &#13;&#10;1.Mrs. Phai T., 52, who sells wooden cutting boards used for chopping meat. T. requested a loan of $300 to buy a secondhand motorcycle for transportation.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;2.Mrs. Hing P., 46, sells desserts and Khmer noodles in front of her house.

Normally, he brings his customers from the village to the market, earning around $3 per day, while his wife, Mrs. Sokhim Rom, 29, works as a vegetable seller. Sokhim has run her business since 2004, and she also looks after two children, both of whom are students. The family lives in Prektaho Commune, Kompong Tom Province. Sokhim has trouble finding a place to sell; she needs a permanent shop. Lim decided to request a loan of $400 to purchase a small shop in the local market for his wife to sell vegetable. The loan will increase their income to cover their daily expenses.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>213381</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits

Over the years, Khalil has learned that it is far less expensive to buy spare parts in bulk by their wholesale unit price, rather than individually. He has therefore requested a loan of $1,000 from Al Majmoua to purchase the wholesale spare parts which will help him increase his small business&apos;s profitability.

He owns a mini market selling basic household needs, such as kitchen supplies, which also delivers Nargileh and coffee to neighborhood clients. Nargileh is a traditional and popular Lebanese water-pipe which is used to smoke flavored tobacco. It is the custom in Lebanon to pass free time by sitting with friends and relatives on the sidewalks of businesses and homes sipping dark Turkish coffee and smoking Nargileh. Thus, Muhammad is always busy distributing Nargileh and coffee, refilling his patron&apos;s coals and cups throughout the day and night. Muhammad has requested a loan of $700 to purchase a new stock of products for his market of more Nargileh items in order to meet the increasing demand of his clients. Muhammad has been an Al Majmoua micro-credit for five years, and has always made his payments on schedule.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>213388</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General

She sells cooked rice with fried pork and hot dogs for passengers. She has been selling since 2000 and earns around $4 per day. She cares for four children, all of whom attend school. H. works hard every day in her business. She lives in Prek Preahsdach Commune, Battambang Province. One of her children is a garment worker and another is a tailor; their income helps to cover the family&apos;s expenses. To grow her business, she needs to cook more rice and also make a variety of food to satisfy customers. Hence, she would like to request a loan of $700 to purchase ingredients such as rice, meat, and hot dogs. For her future plan, H. wants to have her own store in which to run and expand her business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>213394</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

Munira is a very responsible and hard-working woman. She is married and has 2 adorable children. Eight years ago, Munira decided to start her own business. She was working in a garment factory near her home and knew a lot about sewing designs of the national carpet. So with some savings, she opened a small seamstress shop in her house, which helps her husband support the family. In time, she gained customers and a good reputation for her work. Her elder daughter also helps her with the business. Munira’s children are all studying at school, and  next year her daughter is planning to enter University. That is the reason that she needs to continue growing her business. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Munira is requesting a loan of 2500 Somoni ($750) that she plans to invest in buying new, modern designs. She commits to paying back the loan in 12 months. Help this family improve the quality of their life by contributing to the growth of Munira’s business. They will sincerely thank you for your generosity.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>213414</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Sewing</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

She is dedicated to caring for him at all times. It is for this reason that she works everyday. She wants to support her young daughter as her daughter cares for her small son. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Zuhra has worked in her business for 14 long years. She used to acquire clothes sporadically, but at very high prices. For this reason she came to Dushanbe; she wanted to receive loans so she could acquire merchandise in bulk to then market and sell it. She has received 6 loans, all repaid on time and in the correct manner. These loans have been used to buy stock and to improve the quality of life for her, her daughter and her grandson. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now Zuhra is requesting a loan of 3400 Somoni ($1025 USD) for the term of 7 months. She wants to increase the selection of her autumn clothing she has for sale. You could become an important part in Zuhra&apos;s life. She deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1025</funded_amount><paid_amount>1025</paid_amount><image><id>213419</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Muhiba describes herself as a hard-working, enterprising and happy married mother of two children. Her husband is a laborer. She decided to start a tailoring business to help him with household expenses. She wanted her children to get an education and that wasn&apos;t possible on her husband&apos;s salary alone. She started by helping a woman who ran a tailoring shop. After she learned the business well, she installed a small shop in her home. During the last 20 years, the business has gone very well and grown. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Now Muhiba is requesting a loan of 2500 Somoni ($750). She plans to use the loan to purchase modern materials so she can fulfill her customers&apos; requests for national dresses. Muhiba and her family are very grateful for your support in helping this business grow and move ahead.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>750</funded_amount><paid_amount>750</paid_amount><image><id>213429</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

He was born in Kabala about 38 years ago. Yaya is married to a business woman and the two have four children, all of whom are in primary schools. Yaya deals in cattle and has been in this business for the past 15 years now. He buys the cattle in villages surrounding Kabala, including Dogulia and Bindi. He sells in Kabala and sometimes in Bo and Kenema, both larger cities in southern and eastern Sierra Leone. Prices for cattle in the villages vary depending on the size of the cattle (between Le 70,000 and Le 90,000). He then sells the cattle at prices between Le 80,000.00 and 110,000.00.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in his business, Yaya encounters some challenges. Challenges include slow sales, sick or dead cattle and theft. In certain cases, however, Yaya can overcome the challenge of a sick animal by taking it to the veterinarian. Previous loans have helped Yaya a great deal. Yaya was able to buy a motorbike that he uses as transportation to villages where he purchases the cattle. He can also now pay for school fees, food and clothes for his children. He is thankful for SMT, as SMT loans have improved his living condition tremendously.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Kiva loans to Yaya are making him and his family happy because of the financial benefit he receives from such loans. With the increased profits gained through these loans, Yaya says the burden of taking care of his family is reduced.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1175</funded_amount><paid_amount>1175</paid_amount><image><id>213438</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cattle</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Yaya

Ce petit commerce lui a permit d’avoir une clientèle conséquente et en même temps une hausse de la demande.&#13;&#10;&#9;&#13;&#10;Pour répondre aux besoins de ses clients, il sollicite un financement pour ouvrir une petite librairie et constituer un stock important en manuels scolaires neufs et usagers et en divers fournitures et articles scolaires. Ce financement lui permettra de relever ses revenus et son niveau de vie.</fr><en>Mr. El-Pidio Komla D. E. was born in Lomé on December 18, 1984 and is a young single man without a steady job. This has forced him into small local trades such as selling used school textbooks and miscellaneous items by the side of the road. This local trade has brought him a lot of customers as well as created an increase in demand. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To meet the needs of his customers, he is requesting financing to open a small bookstore and stock up on new and used textbooks and various school supplies. This financing will enable him to increase his income and raise his standard of living.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

All members of this group are living in extreme poverty, and decided to try and do something about it. This loan they receive is going to go towards starting their own small businesses which they hope to grow. Romona is the chosen group representative, and she was chosen by this group because they felt she was ready for this role, and is a person of great diligence and leadership. She is the mother of four children, and sees this as a chance to provide for those children. She plans on opening a small clothing store and someday dreams of having a large store and her own vehicle.

She is married and has one daughter who is 13 years old and studying in secondary school.  Her husband works for a business as a store manager.  Estela’s business involves the sale of clothing and cosmetics, an enterprise she started six years ago with her own savings.  Until now, things have gone well with regard to sales given she now has a steady customer base.  However, she would like to expand her inventory so she can grow the business further.  With this request for a loan she would like to buy construction materials to build another room in their small house so the family could live more comfortably.

Edgardo started his business in order to continue his studies and give his son a good start in life as he constantly needs hospitalization, medicine, and care. As a single father he had nobody to help him take care of his son so he decided to start a business that would allow him to look after him and that was the reason he began to work, got a wagon and started to make and sell hot-dogs and sandwiches, at first on week-ends and afterwards daily in front of assembly plants and gas stations.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Edgardo needs a loan of $425 to be repaid in 6 months to remodel the wagon, as it needs paint and has very few furnishings, making it difficult for clients to eat, but with the loan he will buy new tables and chairs thus being able

Celia has five years of experience running her grocery store, a business she started after losing her previous job at the Managua mayor’s office.  All her capital was invested into the sale, which was good since now she has something of her own for support.  Sales are good, and sometimes the persons who deliver her products let her have the merchandise on credit for the next day but she doesn’t have the capital at this time to pay.  With this business, she can also see to caring for her family.  Her request for this loan is to invest in her enterprise, buying a variety of daily use products to offer to her customers.

area. All the women in this group have to fight to get through each day. That is why they came together as a group and are seeking a loan to try and better their lives. They all want to take this loan and start their very own small business, and start generating income. They know this is the first step to bettering their situation. Elsa G. is the representative of this group of 10, and is excited at the chance to lead all her friends into a better life. She is a very hardworking mother and wants nothing more than to better the lives of her children. She plans on starting a small business making and selling food in her area. She hopes to one day expand and have her own restaurant, and make enough money to provide her children with a comfortable life. She and the rest of the group are ready to take the first step to a better life! On behalf of Elsa, the group, and Esperanza International----- Thank you for your

My principal activity is passenger transportation (Taxi #81), and I have many years of experience with this type of occupation.  I am married, and have a daughter in primary school.  Thanks to the income which I receive from my taxi service, I can support my family’s household expenses.

Las ventas de doña Maria son cosméticos y también es costurera desde hace nueve años, inició sólo con la costura pues tiene bastantes clientes ya que su trabajo es bien fino, pero debido a la poca costura que a veces tiene, por que no todos los meses son bueno,  se vió en la necesidad de vender cosméticos ya que son productos que las mujeres usan a diario, pues vende al crédito y al contado. Con la solicitud que está haciendo es para invertir en el negocio en la compra de productos Zermat y comprar juegos de joyas Romannel, así como telas para sus costura. A largo plazo es comprar otra máquina de costura marca Overlok para mejorar las costuras así como seguir invirtiendo en cosméticos, también desea poder brindarle estudios a su hijo menor.</es><en>Maria is 41 years old and lives in the Villa Reconciliación neighborhood.  She is married with two children, 16 and 20 years old.  One is studying in high school, and the 20 year old works and studies, and as well helps his parents.  Her husband is a taxi driver.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Maria sells cosmetics, and she has been a seamstress for nine years.  She started her business only with sewing work and has a good clientele because her work is very detailed.  But because at times she has little sewing work, not all months are good.  Because of this she saw the need to sell cosmetics, since they are products that women use every day.  She sells on credit and with cash, and many times the products are ordered, so it has not been a difficult task to have clientele because part of her clients are from her sewing business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The loan request she is making is to be used to invest in the business, in the purchase of Zermat products and Romanel sets in order to offer and sell more, as well as for fabric for the sewing business.  A goal over the long term is to buy other overlock sewing machines to improve her sewing and as well to continue investing in cosmetics, and to be able to provide schooling to her son.&#13;&#10;&lt;br

She dedicates herself to the sale of mattresses, linens, etc., which she has done for the past three years when she became independent.  Prior to that, she worked with her sisters in the family business.  América works tirelessly from 8 am until 6 pm, at which time she must do double-duty to conduct both her sales work and be a mother which is the most difficult part.  Despite this, América very much enjoys selling mattresses given that with this endeavor she can support her family.

With the money from this loan he will begin a new business, although the type of business has still not been determined, that will allow him to grow and improve his income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Lucia Franzese, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>213648</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle Transport</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>Investment capital to begin a new business</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-19T23:50:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Inocencio</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-03T02:07:40Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:14:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9957378</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:59:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227628</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:01:28Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422863</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:31:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27116086</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:40:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36011046</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.35</amount><local_amount>166.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-16T00:53:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.05</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44594664</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-20T01:07:40Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-06-16T00:53:47Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69573</id><name>Eduarda</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Eduarda tiene 24 años, es soltera y vive en casa de sus padres.

Gregoria enjoys her work and her many years of experience allowed her to do the work with little difficulty. She works hard every day. Her goal is to see her children enjoy a stable economic future. With the loan that Gregoria is requesting she will purchase more ingredients for ice cream production. Over time she hopes that her business will become much larger, and if possible she would like to open another kind of business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>350</funded_amount><paid_amount>350</paid_amount><image><id>213656</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Dairy</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Purchase of ingredients for ice cream production. </use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-19T20:10:09Z</posted_date><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Gregoria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-02T21:27:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>350</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>58.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:14:09Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9957383</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:00:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227633</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:01:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422868</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:31:23Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27116091</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.33</amount><local_amount>166.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:40:04Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.08</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36011051</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>58.35</amount><local_amount>166.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-16T00:53:45Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>179.05</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44594668</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-19T20:27:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-06-16T00:53:45Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69579</id><name>Nancy</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Nancy tiene 38 años, está separada de su pareja y vive con sus hijos; Paulo de 16, Mariela de 15 y Carmen de 13.

Actualmente está vendiendo mandarinas en su triciclo de forma ambulatoria, por las calles de la ciudad de Juliaca.  Usualmente trabaja desde las 8 de la mañana hasta las 3 o 4 de la tarde o inclusive más tiempo, hasta que logre vender casi toda su mercadería.  Lo difícil de su trabajo es tener que variar de mercadería cada vez, y que si no realiza la venta de casi toda su mercadería esta se podría echarse a perder y no recuperar lo invertido, pero los años le han enseñado a María y la venta no se le hace complicada.  Ella trabaja para forjarse un mejor porvenir y ayudar a la estabilidad económica de su familia.  Utilizará el dinero para comprar más fruta e incrementar su venta, ella espera dentro de poco tener un pequeño puesto de fruta en algún mercado de la ciudad.</es><en>Maria is a 40 year old woman who lives with her partner Martiniano. She is a hard working woman who sells seasonal fruit - which is to say that in corn season, she sells corn, if it is pineapple season, she sells pineapple, according to the season. Currently she is selling mandarin oranges from a tricycle door to door on the streets of the city of Juliaca. She generally starts work at 8:00 in the morning, and works until 3 or 4 in the afternoon - sometimes later, until she has sold all of her merchandise. The most difficult thing for her is that she must vary her merchandise each day, and if she is unable to sell everything it may spoil, resulting in the loss of her investment. Over the years Maria has gained experience, and she is able to work without too many complications. She works for a better future and to help with the family finances. She will use the money from this loan to purchase more fruit and to increase her sales. She hopes to soon have a fruit stand in a market in the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>400</funded_amount><paid_amount>400</paid_amount><image><id>213659</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Increase the quanity of fruits sold.</use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-19T20:30:13Z</posted_date><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-02T23:05:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>400</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>66.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>66.67</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:14:15Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9957385</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.67</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T13:59:52Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227635</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.67</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:01:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422870</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.67</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-02T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:31:39Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27116093</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.66</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:40:16Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36011053</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>66.66</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-02T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-16T00:53:48Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>204.64</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44594670</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-19T22:05:51Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-06-16T00:53:48Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69581</id><name>Lourdes</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Lourdes tiene 40 años, vive con su esposo José y con sus cinco hijos, Diego de 19, Juan Carlos de 15, Adriana de 1, María Laura de 13 y Karina de 09 años.

Celestina quiere forjarle un futuro mejor a su hijo y que sea de provecho para la sociedad siendo un buen profesional.

She says &quot;What I like the most is the independence that her business gives me&quot;.  She decides when she will go and start her sales and she can keep going until she is very tired.  She doesn&apos;t find her work too difficult, in fact, she works always happily and with a good sense of humor. Celestina wishes to forge a better future for her son and she wants him to be a productive member of society, to be a hard working professional. With the loan she will purchase more merchandise to expand her business and God willing, in the future, she will have a convenience store of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br

She has worked as a mobile fruit seller in the Las Mercedes market for two years.  She usually works from 8 o&apos;clock in the morning until 4 o 5 o&apos;clock in the afternoon during the week.  Since Maricruz doesn&apos;t have a family she dedicates wholly to her work, which she enjoys. However she, like all young people, wants to grow and better herself by setting up another business that is more profitable and stable, since although selling fruit is profitable, it is difficult for her to transfer the fruit since it is very fragile and has to be handled carefully and many times the bumps the fruit receives while being moved damages it and causes her to lose part of her capital.  Maricruz works hard to build a better future for herself; she wants to be a young entrepreneur with a successful future.   With the loan she will invest in the purchase of more fruit to improve her business and with earnings put up another business to help her with her finances.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>213669</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fruits &amp;

He is single and lives alone in the house that his parents left for him.  For eight years he has dedicated himself to providing motorcycle taxi services as he did not have an opportunity to continue his studies after high school.  He had to think of a way to pay for his expenses and after saving he was able to purchase his motorcycle.  His motorcycle accompanies him in the early hours of the day through the streets of the city of Juliaca.  What Oswaldo likes about working with his motorcycle is that he can take his mind off of things since he sometimes feels alone.  During this time he has learned his trade well and does not find it difficult to carry out.  His reason for working is to forge a better future for himself.  With the money he is requesting he will purchase some parts for his motorcycle which is not working well so that he can provide a better service for his clients.  In the future, he wants to have another small business so that he can improve his economic situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Spanish by Cindy Manzo, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>213674</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Motorcycle Transport</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>Purchase parts to repair his motorcycle. </use><location><country_code>PE</country_code><country>Peru</country><town>Juliaca</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-15.5 -70.133333</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>71</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-24T00:30:19Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Oswaldo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-07T14:01:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>PEN</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1300</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-07T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-07T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>216.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>70.83</amount><local_amount>216.67</local_amount><processed_date>2008-12-07T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-01-16T01:17:29Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>9957396</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>70.83</amount><local_amount>216.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-07T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-15T14:03:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>10227646</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>70.83</amount><local_amount>216.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-02-07T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-03-16T20:03:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>20422881</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>70.83</amount><local_amount>216.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-07T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T20:33:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27116105</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>70.83</amount><local_amount>216.67</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-07T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T21:43:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.45</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36011065</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>70.85</amount><local_amount>216.65</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-07T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-16T00:54:47Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>217.43</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44594680</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-24T13:01:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-06-16T00:54:47Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69594</id><name>Olga</name><description><languages type="list"><language>es</language><language>en</language></languages><texts><es>Olga tiene 33 años, es soltera, vive sola en la casa de sus padres.

Desde que Estefanía decidió independizarse, para realizar la venta de los helados, le ha ido muy bien, ya que ella le pone muchas ganas y empeño a todo lo que hace. Usualmente vende durante las mañanas, que es donde se consumen más los helados y también parte de las tardes. Le gusta su trabajo porque le permite interactuar con la gente, haciendo amistad con las personas mayores y los niños, que son los que más consumen estos ricos helados, la parte difícil de su trabajo es tener que lidiar con el clima, ya que muchas veces por estas zonas las mañanas son nubladas, llueve o graniza, haciendo que la demanda baje.   Estefanía quiere asegurar su vejez, trabajando ahora que aún es joven, ya que al no contar con hijos que velen por ella, se preocupa por su futuro.  Con el dinero que solicita comprará mayores insumos, para elaborar sus helados, así como cajas de tecnopor, que es donde los mete para venderlos y así hacer que en el futuro su negocio sea mucho más productivo y rentable.</es><en>Estefanía is 40 years old.  She is divorced and she lives alone.  She does not have any children.  For the past 9 years she has worked making ice creams in her own business, but she has 20 years of experience, as she began working in an ice cream factory.  Since Estefanía decided to become independent, in order to sell ice creams, it has gone very well, and she currently gets good profits and sells all that she has.  Usually she sells during the mornings, which is when people eat most of the ice cream, and also in part of the afternoons.  She likes to work because it allows her to interact with people, making friends with adults and children, who eat most of her delicious ice creams.  The difficult part of her business to have to fight the climate.  Often, in her area it is cloudy in the mornings, or it is raining or hailing, which lowers demand. Estefanía wants to have a secure old age.  She has worked since she was a child, and now since she doesn’t have children of her own to care for her she worries about her future.  With the money that she is asking for she would buy better ingredients in order to improve her ice creams and styrofoam boxes, which is what she puts them in to sell them, so that in the future her

She has been selling food for 10 years when she worked for other people, but she finally decided to become independent and open her own business, so she bought a tricycle and since then has been selling food as a street vendor.  Elsa prepares the food very early in the morning and sells form 11 until 2 in the afternoon, during which time her tricycle is surrounded by many customers anxious to enjoy her delicious dishes. She very much likes to cook, but the rising prices make her ingredients much more expensive, but in spits of these challenges she stays firm in being able to make her goals reality. Her wish is to be successful for her daughters, to whom she would like to provide all the comforts she can and she hopes that they have better possibilities to be professionals in the future. With the money she is seeking she will buy more ingredients and some kitchen utensils to improve her customer service. In the future she wants to open a business in a permanent location, she still hasn’t decided of this will be a restaurant or a small grocery store.&#13;&#10;&lt;br

Kampong Chhnang Province and Mrs. Ry P. is the village bank president who was selected by the members. She is a healer who cures patients in the local village. Since she now has a lot of patients, she does not have enough money to purchase more medicine for her patients so she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. Her husband, Mr. Sorn Sout, is a cow breeder who raises three cows. Mrs. Ry P. is 55 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory, while the others are attending the local school. Mrs. Lan Y. does not come to take a loan but her husband is so he is presented in the picture. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Four members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1250</funded_amount><paid_amount>1250</paid_amount><image><id>213741</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Services</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>These

Ey Sam Ort&apos;s Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nine people in Da Village in Kampong Chhnang Province form the village bank and they plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mr. Ey S. O. is the village bank president and he is a fisherman in the local lake. In this business, he now faces a small problem because he does not have enough money to purchase more fishnets to catch more fish. His wife, Mrs. Nhil S. Oeurn, is a farmer who owns a hectare to cultivate rice to earn for a living. Mr. Ey S. O. is 46 years old and the father of five childR., one of whom is employed in a garment factory, while the others help their parents&apos; business. Mr. Ey S. O. hopes he can make more income to improve his living condition with this new loan. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Six members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>875</funded_amount><paid_amount>875</paid_amount><image><id>213745</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fishing</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>These

Village in Kampong Chhnang Province. She is a cake seller door-to-door. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more ingredients to make the delicious cakes for her customers. Her husband, Mr. Sieng Horn, has a plot of land where he can cultivate rice to earn a living. Mrs. Seng P. has three children, two of whom are attending the local school while the youngest one is too young to work or stuD. because he is three years old. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>213749</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Bakery</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Seng

Pon Than&apos;s Village Bank Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>The Village Bank, which consists of thirty-one members, is located in Au Da Village in Kampong Cham Province and all the members will use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Pon T. is the village bank president and she is a pig and cow breeder. Since the fist business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets for breeding. Her husband, Mr. PhE. ThE., is a construction foreman who can make little income to support his famiL.. Mrs. T. is 37 years old and the mother of four children, three of whom are attending the local school while the youngest one is too young to wO. or study because that child is five. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a village bank loan consisting of mainL. end-of-term loans. Six members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthL. payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK&apos;s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia&apos;s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financialL. able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK&apos;s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of onL. 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>3900</funded_amount><paid_amount>3900</paid_amount><image><id>213757</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>These

Sutari participated in the pig farming program. From the capital of Rp.5.000.000, she bought 2 piglets, Rp. 3000.000 used to to buy pig feedings, and Rp.1000.000 to repair the pig sty. She lives with her husband Gede Natra at their own home. Her husband also help her with rearing the pigs. The profit from this pig farming, will be used to sustain their daily life, and increase their number of pigs.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Bernard Lim, Kiva volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Walaupun sudah tidak menanggung anak, Ni Komang Sutari tetap berusaha untuk kelanjutan hidupnya. Ni Komang Sutari bergabung dengan program ternak babi selama 6 bulan dan masa pengembalian pinjaman pada akhir periode. Dengan  modal pinjaman Rp.5.000.000,- Ni Komang Sutari membeli bibit babi sebanyak 2 ekor karena bibit sudah besar.  Kandang yang dimiliki untuk memelihara babinya sangat sederhana, terbuat dari dinding bambu dan lantai semen. Selain membeli bibit babi, uang sejumlah Rp. 3000.000,- digunakan untuk membeli pakan. Sisa yang Rp.1000.000 untuk perbaiki kandang. Kadang - kadang pemberian pakan babi diselingi dengan makanan tradisional seperti: batang pisang, daun lantoro dan kangkung. Rumah yang dihuni sekarang bersama suaminya, Gede Natra, adalah rumah milik sendiri.  Suami Sutari juga sering membantu istrinya memberi makan babinya. Semua keuntungan yang didapat digunakan untuk kebutuhan sehari-hari dan juga untuk pengembangan usaha babinya.</id></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>213775</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Membeli anak babi, pakan dan memperbaiki kandang</use><location><country_code>ID</country_code><country>Indonesia</country><town>Melaya, Bali</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>-5 120</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>82</partner_id><posted_date>2008-10-30T17:50:25Z</posted_date><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ni Komang Sutari</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2008-11-13T23:46:47Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>IDR</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>5000000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2008-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-02-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-03-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-04-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2009-05-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>833333.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-03-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-04-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-05-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2009-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>partner</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>1666666.66</local_amount><processed_date>2009-01-13T08:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-02-20T09:01:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1701841.72</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>14849840</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>175</amount><local_amount>1666666.66</local_amount><processed_date>2009-03-13T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-04-15T17:45:25Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1701841.72</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27080667</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.49</amount><local_amount>833333.33</local_amount><processed_date>2009-04-13T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-05-15T15:21:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>850920.86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35973874</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>87.51</amount><local_amount>833333.35</local_amount><processed_date>2009-05-13T07:00:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2009-06-15T22:29:27Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>850920.87</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44434552</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2008-10-30T22:46:47Z</funded_date><paid_date>2009-06-15T22:29:27Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>3</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>69626</id><name>Wema Hauozi Group</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rehema has owned a shop in Zanzibar for three years.

He is married and has 6 children -- their ages range from 1 to 18 years old. 4 of them are in school. Besides his family he also supports his mother by sending her food every month. Raimundo went to school up until only the 5th grade because his father passed away and his mother&apos;s income as a farm laborer was not enough to pay for education expenses. Due to the turmoil created by the Frelimo/Renamo war, he had to leave his hometown and move to Maputo with his parents. When the conflict ended they returned to Chibuto but he decided to stay. Raimundo works as a farmer since 1996; he starts his shift at the &quot;machambas&quot; (smallholdings) at 5:30am and ends them at 6:00pm. Everyday he has to face the struggle of not having access to public transportation to go back home (10 kilometers away) after his shift is over. This will be Raimundo&apos;s second loan request. The first one was in the amount of 10000,00mt and it was used to purchase agricultural supplies. He paid it off before the loan&apos;s term date because production was satisfactory. With this loan he intends to purchase more supplies to further expand his land&apos;s productive area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva

Since 2003, she has been using beads and other materials to make flowers on women&apos;s clothes to earn a living and typically makes US$5 each day. Decorated dresses are a kind of Khmer traditional dress and people wear them during the Water Festival, P&apos;chum Ben or Khmer New Year. It takes around 7–10 days to complete each dress and its price is expensive. Most of the people prefer handmade than machine made. She said she learned how to decorate from her mother and she started doing this business because she was not married yet. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Khin&apos;s husband is a pig breeder making around US$6 each day. The high prices of rice, fertilizers, meat and feed for animals had made his family work very hard to support the family. He said the purchase price of rice dust, soybean and other stuff for pigs are double what he used to pay, so when he sells the pigs it is not balanced with the cost of raising them. This couple hopes the government will soon take action on inflation. Khin S. would like to take out a loan of US$1200 to expand the livestock and grow rice. She believes the investment would bring her more profit.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>213804</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Crafts</activity><sector>Arts</sector><use>Khin
