P. runs a small business weaving silk clothes.  This business generates about $42 per day in revenue.  P.&apos;s husband is a doctor in a small clinic in their village.  Although they make more money than the average Cambodian family, they have 11 children to support.  Three of these children have families of their own, but still live with P. and her husband.  Two more of the children help P. with her silk weaving business, while the other six are still students.  They hope to use this loan to purchase more silk threads for their business.  In the future, they hope that they will be able to teach all of their children how to weave silk clothes.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>41455</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Her two children are studying in the university already, and Tamara is proud to work hard and support them throughout their higher education, something which she was never able to complete due to lack of financial support. To ensure her continued success, she works only with high-quality products and goes to great lengths to satisfy her customers&apos; demands. Now Tamara would like a loan to expand her inventory of goods and to begin growing her business. In order for her to get a good deal on merchandise she will travel to Odessa in Ukraine (a major port city), where she will purchase 100 pairs of shoes at $10 a pair.  In the future, she hopes to also add a new table so as to have more space and attract more

Chim and her husband are farmers and own a plantation where they grow rubber trees.  They have 11 children, all of whom help them on the rubber tree plantation.  From their plantation, they are able to make about $25 per day.  They hope to use this loan for two purposes.  First, they want to repair their house so that it does not leak during the rainy season.  Additionally, they hope to purchase more seeds in order to grow more rubber trees.  In the future, the family hopes to purchase more land so that they can expand their rubber

She recently settled into agriculture, specifically cereal and vegetable production. She and her husband work in both growing and selling their crops in the village of Văleni, which is outside of Cahul, the largest city in the southern part of Moldova.  Having a vehicle for transportation and buyer contacts in both Romania and Ukraine enables them to be their own wholesalers. Formerly, Vera simply bought produce from local growers and consolidated it for sale abroad, but the income she received from this activity was insufficient and she decided to begin growing the most profitable of the crops she dealt with. She would like to take a loan to help finance the initial costs – mechanically cultivating the soil and obtaining high-quality seed stock, which will yield a desirable harvest.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>41470</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To

After his education, he tried repeatedly to find employment but was refused by all the workplaces he applied to. Discouraged but not ready to give up, Ivan has decided to open his own business in repairing shoes, drawing on his education and the instruction he received in childhood from his father. He studied the local market and observed that there was no such service available anywhere in his neighborhood; he then began working and found many eager clients.

Challenged by his untimely retirement and the hardship  which it brought, he resorted to farm-to-mouth practice for survival.  Later on he struggled and succeeded in starting a piggery which has never really been rewarding. This hardship and the changes he saw in the lives of other community members who were members of GHAPE in his community, has motivated him to join the GHAPE program. With his training in Piggery, Henry is prepared to revitalize his pig-farm. Given a loan of $75, he plans to buy 1-piglet and feed. He plans to repay the loan during the

For one month she spents Tk. 12,000 for their food. After one month she sells them @ Tk. 85/ per kg. So her investment is Tk. 27,000 (500 x Tk. 30 = Tk. 15,000) + food cost Tk. 12,000) And she earns Tk. 42,500 ( 500 x Tk. 85/). So her profit is Tk. 42,500 – Tk. 27,000) = Tk. 15,500. If the growth is more than one kg. each,  she gets more amount of profit.  Of course, she has not calculated her own labor cost.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The firm is in her own land she does not have to pay any rent.

Even when she got married, her husband could not afford enough money to send her back to school, considering the fact that he (a technician) is not getting contracts to provide for the family and other expenditures. Yvonne has taken and repaid loans from GHAPE. She   is asking for another loan to enable her expand her business. She feels that with a bigger loan, she will be able to provide fowl and pigs to those who sell processed chicken and pork. She is involved in the sale of cabbages and other foods.

Together, they are able to make about $5 per day.  Of their four children, one works at a local garment factory, while the other three are still in school.  They hope to use this loan to purchase a motorcycle so that they can transport the vegetables from their farm to R.&apos;s stall at the market.

Begum of 30 years old (ID-579 – M), wife of M. K. Ahmed 35 years of age, is a member of Chetona Mohila Somity. She has a daughters – one 8 and another 1 year old. Her husband’s income is very low so she is passing her days in a hardship situation. She realizes that she must be a earning source for the family and be self-sufficient. She got a 7-day training on Poultry. She purchases 400 one-day old chicks @ Tk. Tk. 30 each. For one month she spents Tk. 10,000 for their food. After one month she sells them @ Tk. 85/ per kg. So her investment is Tk. 22,000 (400 x Tk. 30 = Tk. 12,000) + food cost Tk. 10,000) and she earns Tk. 34,000 (400 x Tk. 85/). So her profit is Tk. 34,000 – Tk. 22,000) = Tk. 12,000. If the growth is more than one kg. each,  she gets more amount of profit.  Of course, she has not calculated her own labor cost.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The firm is in her own land she does not have to pay any rent. She is earning good profit and she is interested to extend her farm. She wants to purchase more layers.

This skill coupled with her training in marketing techniques, credit management, and experience in the utilization and repayment of previous loans, and available support from group and center members makes her an excellent candidate to receive a loan. Given a loan of $400, she plans to buy farm chemicals; insecticides, fertilizer and improved-seeds, This investment will provide her community with food.

One is still in secondary school but the rest are all working. He is a trained pastor with a local church (Deliverance Church of Kenya). He also operates a clothing business together with his wife. He started his business in 1991 as a second-hand cloth seller, then later started selling new clothes. &lt;P&gt;James buys new clothes from Nairobi and Kitale at wholesale prices and in turn sells them in Malaba at retail price.

Realizing the heavy school needs of her children, she sought assistance from GHAPE when she joined the program in 2005 and took her first loan of $40 which she invested in the production of tapioca. She has suceeded in this business because she grows the cassava herself and on her own piece of land. There is a ready market for her Gateau, provided by the nearby school. School children have been benefiting immensely from her activities as they are the greatest consumers of her produce.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $500, she hopes to increase the size of her cassava farm to meet the increasing demand.

Things became very difficult for her when her first son on whom she had invested a lot died in a car accident. Unable to raise  sustainable business capital, she decided to join GHAPE. In the year 2004 Emilia received her first loan of $40 which she used in retailing foodstuffs. Food is something people cannot do without and she therefore has a ready market. With the ever increasing demand, there is need for her to increase the size of her business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $800, she plans to buy plantains, yams, beans, and maize. With all these food items in stock, she may be able to meet most of the expectations of her customers. The profit she gets from the business will be used to meet her children’s school needs and for medication.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to repay the loan during the loan term.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>41506</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Sale of foodstuffs</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

Two are still in secondary school while two are involved in the family business. Daniel is training as a truck driver but has also been in business for the last thirty years. He operates a store where he sells maize, beans, tomatoes and onions as well as manufactured retail goods. Daniel also operates a hardware shop, side-by-side with the other shops. &lt;P&gt;To support business, Mr K. ventured into Southern Sudan in 2004 where he also operates a hardware shop selling mainly construction materials such as iron sheets, nails, cement, etc. Although the demand for the goods is high in Southern Sudan, Daniel has been faced with challenges when it comes to expanding his business due to lack of capital. The other challenge that he faces is the high cost of transporting goods into Southern Sudan. &lt;P&gt;With the proposed loan of US$ 475, Daniel intends to increase his stock of goods for Sudan and hence be able to supply his customers with all the commodities that they need in the required volume.  In view of the contribution that Daniel is making towards the reconstruction of Southern Sudan, we highly recommend the loan for funding through Kiva.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>475</funded_amount><paid_amount>475</paid_amount><image><id>41510</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Buy Additional Stock</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Kitale, Mount Elgon</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>27</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-08T08:51:21Z</posted_date><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Daniel</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-22T18:17:53Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>475</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>475</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.15</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>79.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-22T09:16:43Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>34324</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-22T09:16:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45210</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-22T09:19:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>57453</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-22T09:19:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70691</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-22T10:20:51Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>85024</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>101062</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-08T18:17:53Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-22T10:17:08Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11666</id><name>Mehpara</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>This 32-year-old woman has her own store.

He started his business early this year. The business is located at Malaba Town along the Uganda road. He sells manufactured retail goods and cereals. &lt;P&gt;Patrick operates the kiosk hand-in-hand with his wife. He is a pastor at his church (Victory Churches International). He started his business in order to raise his living standard. His capital right now can be estimated at three hundred US dollars in stock.

At first she used to make dresses and sell at the trading centre, but she quit when she saw there was stiff competition from second-hand clothes. She turned to selling cereals.  &lt;P&gt;Martha says her business is doing well.  She also moulds bricks and sells them at construction sites.

After his primary education, he was unable to continue with secondary education due to lack of school fees. Thus he opted to start out in business. &lt;P&gt;At first, Augustine was a cereal seller.Though the business was good, there was stiff competition and he decided to open up a little restaurant when he saw there was an unmet demand.  He used the money he had saved from his cereal business as capital and his little restaurant is doing well. His customers are mainly market people so during market days he is quite busy.  &lt;P&gt;Augustine&apos;s little restaurant is right at the market centre so his customers have easy access to his services.  Through his business, he has been able to offer employment opportunities to two youths who work hand-in-hand with him. He has been an inspiration to the youth in his community and has been able to support his parents and his sibling. He has also been able to purchase cattle and develop his farm. &lt;P&gt;Augustine is not yet married. With the loan of $75 from PEMCI, he wishes to increase on his stock of foodstuffs for his little restaurant.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>41537</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Expand restaurant business</use><location><country_code>KE</country_code><country>Kenya</country><town>Kimaiti, Bungoma District</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>1 38</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>27</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-09T05:57:49Z</posted_date><loan_amount>75</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Augustine</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-23T13:27:26Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>75</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>75</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-23T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-23T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>12.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>13</amount><local_amount>13</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-23T09:16:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>13</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>34594</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>13</amount><local_amount>13</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-23T09:16:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>13</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45466</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>13</amount><local_amount>13</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-23T09:17:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>13</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>57707</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>13</amount><local_amount>13</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-23T09:17:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>13</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>70927</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>13</amount><local_amount>13</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-23T10:19:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>13</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>85477</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>10</amount><local_amount>10</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>10</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>101476</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-09T13:27:26Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-23T10:17:06Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11682</id><name>Leonora Imojong</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Leonora is a mother of eight children, some in primary and others in secondary school.

Thanks to the teachings of his family, especially his grandfather, he has been able to make an independent living on short growth cycle crops.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Herleen is asking for a loan to be able to plant and produce the aforementioned crops, as they are high yielding in the Daule region.  From the planting to the application of fertilizers and herbicides, it is a technical process to reduce risks for the harvest.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Herleen is 24 years old.  Because he is single, he hasn&apos;t had the opportunity to have children.  He lives in a house made of cement and wood and he has lived in this area his whole life.  He hopes to invest in agriculture and thereby increase his income, giving him much more economic stability.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Bianca Vargas, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Herleen se ha dedicado a la agricultura de manera responsable teniendo ya 8 anos de experiencia, dedicándose netamente a la producción del cultivo de arroz.

This brother was so caring and the loss was so devastating to her.&#13;&#10;Secondly,  since she trades in smoked fish, she went to a fishing town to buy smoked fish and was held hostage by thieves who took all her money. In the course of the delay, her smoked fish got fermented and her business was ruined. &lt;p&gt;She has taken a GHAPE loan before and paid it back. GHAPE has trained her and is giving its loans at very low interest rates. Alice says she intends to retail this fish. It will help her community a lot since even the poor can at least afford smaller quantities for smaller costs. Secondly, she will be selling some of the fish at home, where people can buy after official shopping hours.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>41616</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish Selling</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Trading in smoked fished</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

She has two children now after losing her first son in August, 2005 in a motor accident.  This destabilized her completely because this son was already in a professional school and all her hopes were based on him. When he died, it was as if the world had come to an end, since in most polygamous families in Cameroon, each wife virtually takes care of herself. &lt;p&gt;She is asking for a loan of $75. She intends to do a business of frying of what is called Accra beans (doughnuts). She believes this will be a great success because she is the only person supplying this product to families in her neighborhood for breakfast.  Florence also intends to cultivate mushrooms for commercial purposes in her neighborhood. She also believes this will be a success because GHAPE has given her good training. The profit from this business is going to help her educate the rest of her children in school and take care of the rest of her family’s needs.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>41619</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Frying of Accra and Growing of Mushrooms</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Mile-Two, Bamenda, NW.

She is getting old but none of her children is able to support her because of unemployment and so she has to fend for herself. She fell seriously sick and there was no one to look after her pineapple farm and so thieves broke into it and made away with all the ripe fruits. Motivated by this, she joined GHAPE in 2004 and received her first loan of $40 which she used in opening up a poultry business. With the increased demand for pineapples by members of her community, there is need for her to revamp her pineapple farm. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With a loan of $400, Christina hopes to plant more pineapples, buy more chicks for her poultry business and some vaccines.

She thinks her husband abandoned her because he could not take care of their sick child who has been regularly in and out of hospital.  Meeting the health-care needs of her child and dealing with the loss of her parents and husband are Evelyn&apos;s motivations to get into business. After completing GHAPE&apos;s initial training module which contains, amongst other things, basic health-care, group dynamics, marketing techniques, and credit and general management, Evelyn is ready for her first loan. &lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $75, Evelyn plans to buy Accra-beans, groundnut oil and firewood to start producing and serving her community, especially school children, a locally popular snack, Accra, fried bean paste. It is rich in proteins and is popular with young and old. One of Evelyn&apos;s sub-goals for her business is that she wants to build and establish good customer service skills. She plans to repay the loan in a timely manner.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>41652</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Production of fast food</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

She frequently faces health challenges. These problems motivated her to start a micro-finance business. Tapioca (a starchy food produced from cassava tubers) is consumed on a very large scale in her community. She started and succeeded in providing tapioca to her community on a daily basis. Her community benefited a lot from her activities as her products were always available even at home and community members didn&apos;t have to wait until market days before having tapioca.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Beltha has gained patronage from many people within and outside her community mainly because of her quality goods and customer service. She has a desire to provide quality and quantity goods in order to keep up with the demand. Given a loan of $400, she plans to farm cassava on a large scale since it’s the main component of tapioca. Since cassava is perishable, producing tapioca with cassava from her own farm will be cheaper and more reliable than buying .

She faces difficulties taking care of her children’s needs and her husband is also unemployed. She joined GHAPE in the year 2000 and took her first loan of $30 which she used in retailing firewood. In her community, firewood is the major source of energy for cooking and the small households can’t go to the forest to buy from there due to distance and heavy cost of transportation. Mary has been solving this problem by bringing in the wood in bulk, splitting it and retailing to the small households for immediate use.&lt;P&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $800, Mary plans to buy two trucks of wood and pay for splitting. In this way, she will be able to meet up with the ever increasing demand for firewood.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She plans to repay the loan over a period of 18 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>41668</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fuel/Firewood</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Sale of firewood</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Dora</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Dora was born in 1956; she is the only wife of Mr. Asa Awa Joseph and has four children. What makes her so discouraged in life is the fact that she is not able to take care of her family’s financial needs, especially the education of her children. Her husband, too, is not financially viable. &lt;P&gt;The most painful incident in Dora&apos;s life is the fact that she lost her mother and her brother in the same year. This affected her very strongly, especially her finances since she had to take care of them when they were sick. &lt;P&gt;Dora  thinks her video cassette business is a good thing because she is able to rent or sell cassettes to her neighbors and even outside her neighborhood. These cassettes provide relaxation in the evening after a hard day’s work and hence a source of pleasure to the community.  GHAPE also gives out loans at very low interest which is extremely uncommon here.  &lt;P&gt;Dora is making a good profit. The expansion of this business will help her take care of her family. She plans to repay the loan over a period of 12 months.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>41674</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Renting and selling of video cassettes</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Mile-Two, Bamenda, NW.

She thinks that  a business selling firewood would be very profitable because there is no wood for fuel in her quarter, especially now during the rainy season. She wants to be able to supply this wood to her community and reduce the distance they cover in search of wood, while continuing to dress the hair of the ladies there. She hopes to help her husband pay for her children’s education and improve their living standards. This will make her very happy.&#13;&#10;She will repay her loan during the

There, he worked in various jobs, the blacksmith trade among them, and this has been his field of work since then.  Nevertheless, his greatest dream is to run a little bakery, which is something he also did in the past.  He is already acquiring the necessary equipment for this business, but he still needs a dough mixer.  This is why he asking for a loan, to buy a second hand mixer and realize his dream.       &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated by Bianca Vargas, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Claudio Martínez tiene actualmente 41 años pero aún sigue soltero, no tiene hijos y vive con su madre en una casa humilde que comparte con otros 2 hermanos.&#13;&#10;Hace 12 años viajó a la Argentina en busca de mejores horizontes. Allí realizó varios tipos de trabajos, entre ellos la herrería y se dedica a eso desde ese entonces.&#13;&#10;No obstante su mayor anhelo es montar una pequeña panadería, actividad que también conoce

para comprar una de segunda mano y de esa forma cumplir su sueño.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>41684</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Blacksmith</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>Buy

To increase the size of her business and keep investing in her children&apos;s education, Nov S. is asking for $800 to purchase more grocery items to satisfy her clients&apos; needs. In the future, S. hopes to have enough money to maximize her store with a great variety of products.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>41810</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

(One of her children is pictured here in their market because S. was unavailable.) She lives in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. She makes her living by selling fruits to both wholesalers and at retail at a busy market where she normally makes around $35 in revenue. S. has to get up in the early morning to purchase fruits from somone&apos;s plantation and then deliver them to the market. Additionally, two of her children assist in selling fruits when S. is unavailable and the rest are attending school. &lt;p&gt;Due to the needs of her clients and the increasing size of her business, S. is asking for $1000 to purchase more fruits. In the future, she aims to keep improving this size of business, so that she will have enough money to afford to build a new house and offer a better education to her children.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>41832</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She has three children, two in secondary school and one self-employed. She runs a shop selling different types of building materials.The shop is located in a very strategic place and customers usually favor her shop because it easy to reach. Most building materials are bulky, therefore a shop must be located near the main road for easy carriage. &lt;p&gt;Mariam has attended business and entrepreneurship training from Akiba Commercial Bank. She knows well how to market her items. She sells iron sheets, nails, hammers, woods, cement and many other items. The main item which has high turnover in her shop is cement. The stock of cement need replenishment regularly. She obtains cement from wholesalers who purchase direct from the industries. She buys the cement in packs of 50 kilograms, but due to high demand of the materials she has to re-pack the materials in packs of 5-10 kilograms to enable those who cannot buy the whole 50 kg pack. She requests a loan of USD 1200 to add stock of cement and other items in her shop.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>41837</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction

This keeps her from feeling sad.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Her current request is for money to buy goods in cash, which would be cheaper for her.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>41855</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Purchase goods for cash</use><location><country_code>TJ</country_code><country>Tajikistan</country><town>Istaravshan</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>39.910833 69.006389</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>47</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-11T14:09:10Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Sharifa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-25T20:34:15Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-25T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:21:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31396</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:24:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41861</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:23:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53644</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:22:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66399</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:24:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80400</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95847</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-11T20:34:15Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:26:32Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11761</id><name>Anna</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Anna operates a flourishing business at a small marketplace in Zaporoshye selling dishes. She sells cups, glasses, dinner dishes, pots, pans, thermoses and many other useful kitchen items. She is the only one who sells dishes in her area of the bustling market. Anna is very particular in the quality of her merchandise.  She often travels to a larger city, Dnepropetrovsk, to personally pick out and purchase good, durable dishware in bulk quantities. She also orders dishware from Odessa and has it shipped to her busy little store.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Anna is a very open, fun, likable and lively lady. She is not married but helps support her aging parents financially. Those who work with and around Anna describe her as an honest, hard-working, and trustworthy friend. She has a wonderful reputation at the marketplace. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Anna has run her business for 3 years. She has requested a $500 loan to expand the variety of her products. She was very successful in selling her dishware during the winter months. Now she needs to replace the merchandise she has sold and add a new assortment to her stock. She makes between $200 and $300 a month and has around $600 to $800 invested in inventory. She gives credit for her success to her partnership with Nadezhda Ukraine which allows her to purchase additional assortments of dishware in sufficient quantities and at the right timing.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>41868</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase inventory</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-09T00:07:15Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Anna</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-23T03:30:04Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-22T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-22T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31320</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41782</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53565</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:19:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66330</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:21:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80316</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95749</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-09T03:30:04Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:22:17Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11762</id><name>Minerva Nery</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>MINERVA IS 47 YEARS OLD, MARRIED, TWO CHILDREN.

Many times their friendly and joyous family can be seen together at the market. According to Yelena, her family gives her all the support needed for her business to be a success. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;At the current stage of her business, Yelena would like to boost the variety of seasonal shoes she has to offer. She has asked for a loan of $1,200 to accomplish this goal.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>41874</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Shoe Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>To purchase seasonal shoes</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Berdyansk</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>46.716667 36.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-09T18:59:17Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Yelena</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-25T05:51:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31321</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41783</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53566</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:20:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66331</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:21:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80317</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95750</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-11T05:51:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:22:18Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11764</id><name>Irina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Irina is a single, divorced mom with a 17-year-old son. Her son is taking computer tech courses and she is helping to support him in his ambitions for an exciting career.  Her goal is to expand her grocery business and develop a second store so she can more efficiently provide for her son&apos;s schooling.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Irina has been in business for 5 years. She is well-known and liked and has a reputation for honesty. In all her years partnering with Nadiya Ukraine, she has never been late with a loan payment. She sells a variety of meats, cheeses, butter, frozen produce and other delicious foods at her first location in the Angolenko Market in Zaporoshie. At her second store, Irina has begun selling fruits and would like to add a sizable array of dried fruits and nuts to her product assortment. Her second location has a big advantage as it is near a busy area with a high volume of traffic passing by. The more variety she has available, the more customers she can attract and the more profit she will make to help support her son in his ambitions. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She is asking for a $500 loan from Nadiya Ukraine so that she can sufficiently stock her second store and fill it with the needed products. Irina presently makes around $300 a month with sales from her store. She is excited to see her income rise with the additional sales location.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>42069</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Market</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Increase inventory at new location</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-09T21:07:20Z</posted_date><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Irina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-24T17:11:21Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>500</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>500</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-24T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>83.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-12T09:19:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31322</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:21:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41784</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:20:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53567</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:20:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66332</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>84</amount><local_amount>84</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:21:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>84</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80318</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>80</amount><local_amount>80</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>80</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95751</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-10T17:11:21Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:22:20Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11765</id><name>Aida Delia</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>AIDA IS 29 YEARS OLD, MARRIED, THREE CHILDREN.

His wife passed away and his three children are independent, as such he lives alone.  Raymundo works as a tailor in a workshop in the same area where he lives.  The house on his property is quite old, and the front wall is made of adobe.  It is cracking and is at risk of falling down.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The loan Raymundo is requesting will be used to tear down his old front wall, and replace it with a brick wall.

Este tipo de crédito esta dentro del rubro de Vivienda – refacción, que IMPRO tiene desarrollado como parte de nuestras líneas de crédito.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>41882</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Personal

For 20 years her husband was employed at the mayor&apos;s office , but he recently decided to leave so that he could enjoy himself more, and spend time with Angela and their family.  Because of this, he is now self-employed, and works to build furniture, walls, and improve the electrical connections of houses in his neighborhood.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Angela has opened a small store in their house where she started by selling sodas a household groceries.  With the first loan that she took out from IMPRO, she stocked her store with a variety of products.  This loan has been paid off in full. The current loan she is applying for will be used to purchase more goods for her store, so that she can meet the demand of her neighborhood clients who do not have access to the center of the city.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Angela&apos;s successful credit history with IMPRO qualifies her as a preferential client, and she is now able to apply for a loan of $100.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by a Kiva volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Ángela  vive en casa propia en la zona de llojeta de la Ciudad de la Paz con su esposo, el señor Gumersindo Quenta y su hijo.

El nuevo crédito que Angela solicita ahora es para comprar más productos para  la tienda y poder atender las necesidades de la gente de su barrio y los alrededores, que no tienen acceso al centro de

She started her business as the result of economic pressure, back when the family was unable to pay the household bills. Her husband&apos;s salary was not enough to support the 3 children. She began to investigate what work she could do. About 2 years ago, one of her friends recommended that she sell lingerie and girdles on commission. She decided she&apos;d try that business. Little by little she brought in more clients, which increased her income, since her commissions increased as she sold more clothing.&lt;p&gt;Juana is applying for a loan of $250 to buy merchandise and fill existing client orders. She is offering to repay the loan in 3 to 6 months. She hopes that you will collaborate with her.

Poco a poco fue teniendo más clientes y por ello sus ingresos mejoraban, ya que mientras más vende mayores comisiones recibe.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Juana esta solicitando un préstamo por US$ 250 para comprar mercancía y poder surtir a sus clientes ya que tiene varios pedidos por atender y ofrece pagar el préstamo en un período de 3 a 6 meses.

Espera que la apoyes a salir adelante con su negocio y que pueda crecer y mejorar sus ingresos para poder darle un mejor sustento y educación a sus pequeños hijos, gracias.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>42087</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy more ingredients/supplies for cooking</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Monclova,Coahuila</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>26.9 -101.416667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-18T04:42:56Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria De Jesús</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-07-02T09:16:32Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-02T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-18T09:15:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-18T09:15:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33221</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-18T09:15:51Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-18T09:15:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43926</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-18T09:15:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-18T09:15:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55906</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-18T09:16:32Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-09-18T09:15:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11801</id><name>Rosa Aracely</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosa Aracely is a single mother and has a one-year-old daughter.

Therefore, Angelita can make her own products at home and sell them to other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Angelita started off as a clothes saleswoman in a business venture with a family member. Due to her lack of capital she could not make the business succeed. She does not want the same thing to happen to her in this operation.

Angelita’s first loan went very well. She is very satisfied with the results and she hopes to continue growing. As she expected, she invested in the necessary ingredients to maker her products and also bought some better plastics to sell them in. Her children recently have started helping their mother, but she prefers to keep them somewhat out of the business so they may concentrate on school. She hopes that with the profits of this loan she will also be able to invest in cosmetics as a secondary source of income.

Her husband is an employee of the state highway. Angélica began to sell food 2 years ago because she needed to help her husband with their household expenses and economically supporting their children when he was unemployed. She now has a business partner with whom she takes turns running the business. They don&apos;t have additional workers; their shifts are by days. Angélica sells hamburgers, flautas, sopes and enchiladas on the weekends but in the near future, she hopes to open her own business or buy her partner’s share and run the business by herself. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Angélica asks for a US$ 375 loan to invest in her business. She would like to offer a wider variety of foods in the menu and gain more clients who have commented on the need of other dishes. She offers to pay this loan in 6 to 12 months. She hopes that you support her to make it through. For this she is very grateful with all the people who collaborate.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish to English by Allison Garcia and Amanda Poulton (Glassboro High School’s Honors Spanish III Class) under the supervision of Patricia Yáñez &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;Angélica tiene 28 años de edad, esta casada y tiene 2 hijos en edad escolar que estudian  actualmente en la primaria, su esposo trabaja en la Red Estatal de Autopistas como empleado.

He talks with pride about how he gets up at 2 a.m. every morning to heat the water he sells to people to make mate, a popular drink in Paraguay that requires special preparation to give it its unique taste. His main clients consist of carriers whose route crosses in front of his home. Two of his daughters have successfully completed their studies and today have bright futures thanks to the income Merardo earns. His wife supports him unconditionally. He also runs a snack stand selling empanadas, fried steak, and other foods, and plans to start selling fish as well, since he has a freezer where he can store them. Merardo is a hard working and dedicated person who deserves your support.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Merardo tiene 40 años, es casado,tiene 3 hijas.Cuenta con orgullo que se levanta todos los días a las 2 de la mañana para calentar el agua que luego vende a las personas que la utilizan para la preparación del mate. Comenta que el mate es una bebida que se toma mucho en el Paraguay y que tiene una preparación muy especial en base a remedios que le dan un agradable sabor.&#13;&#10;Sus principales clientes lo constituyen los transportistas que se desplazan por la ruta que cruza frente a su casa. &#13;&#10;Dos de sus hijas lograron culminar sus estudios y hoy día son flamantes docentes gracias al ingreso que Merardo genera con sus ventas. &#13;&#10;Su esposa lo ayuda incondicionalmente, también tiene un pequeño copetín en donde vende empanadas, milanesas y otros tipos de comestibles.&#13;&#10;Planea comprar pescados para poder venderlos posteriormente ya que tiene una congeladora en donde podría almacenarlos. Es una persona muy sacrificada y trabajadora.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>200</funded_amount><paid_amount>200</paid_amount><image><id>42474</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Fish

She has been developing her business for seven years and has had to sacrifice a lot to raise her children, but her sales have been reduced and small businesses like hers cannot compete with the supermarkets that offer a better price and a wider selection.

After she takes the measurements and her clients choose the frames, she sends the glasses in to get the correct lens put in. She mostly sells in her community, but also travels to colleges, churches and hospitals selling her products. She is very popular because there are not any optometrists that will go to their clients, especially in these marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She is currently separated from her husband and has the responsibility of providing for herself and her 15 year old child while he finished high school. Her dream is to finish her studies at the university so she can be a certified optometrist. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Estrella is a repeat Kiva and Mifex lender. She invested her first loan very successfully by purchasing new frames and a second display case. She made great profits on her investment and used them to make several improvements to her newly acquired home. Estrella’s goal is owning her own store where she can keep more products in stock and she will be able to provide better service. She is planning on building the store in a section of her new house. She was very grateful for the loan and hopes to continue working with Kiva and Mifex.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Carlos makes furniture in a shop that he runs out of his home. He started off as an assistant for another furniture maker and learned the trade quickly. With the help of his father and with the money he saved from his job he decided to open up his own business. He rented a location where he could work and sell and he also invested in a couple of necessary tools. He soon realized that the costs of renting were too much and he moved the business into his home. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This business provides for him, his wife and his three children. He uses his earnings to put his kids through school and dreams of them having college degrees. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carlos is now lending for the second time through Kiva and Mifex. Although Carlos planned to invest his first loan in new machinery he found that the costs were extremely high. He bought a second hand polishing tool that has helped, but most of the money from the loan was invested in raw materials. He was able to increase his production and hire a new worker that helps him greatly. He made some basic improvements to his workshop and his home as well. His children are doing well in school and he is grateful for the opportunity to improve his business. He hopes he can receive a second loan so he may continue to purchase raw materials at large quantities. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from English by Maria Ramirez-Gregg, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Carlos hace muebles y gabinetes en su taller, el cual opera desde su hogar. El empezo como asistente de otro ebanista y aprendio el oficio rapidamente.  Con la ayuda de su padre y el dinero que ahorro de su trabajo, Carlos decidio abrir su propio negocio.  El rento un lugar donde pudiera trabajar y vender sus creaciones.  El tambien invirtio en un par de herramientas necesarias.  Carlos pronto se dio cuenta que el costo de rentar un lugar era demasiado y movio su negocio a su hogar.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Este negocio provee para el, su esposa y sus tres hijos.  El usa sus ganancias para costear el costo de la educacion de sus hijos y suena con el dia en que ellos tengan sus diplomas universitarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Esta es la segunda vez que Carlos hace un prestamo atraves de Kiva y MIFEX.  Aunque Carlos planeo invertir su primer prestamo en maquinaria el hallo que los costos eran extremadamente altos.  El compro una pulidora de segunda mano que le ha ayudado pero la mayoria del dinero del primer prestamo fue invertido en materia prima.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; El ha sido capaz de aumentar su produccion y ha podido contratar a un nuevo empleado que le ayuda mucho.  El ha hecho unas mejorias basicas a su taller y a su casa tambien.  Sus hijos van muy bien en la escuela y el esta agradecido de la oportunidad que ha tenido de mejorar su negocio.  El espera poder recibir un segundo prestamo para asi poder continuar comprando materia prima en grandes cantidades.&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>42595</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Furniture

She is an active member of Life in Africa where she participates in the programs offered such as the craft production and Market Day sales. Through these programs she has been able to support herself in Kampala.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She was born in Kitgum in Northern Uganda. In the year 2000 she narrowly escaped being abducted by the LRA rebels and was forced to flee her home. Her aunt, who had resettled in Kampala, offered to take her in. These early days were very difficult, almost as difficult as the life she left behind in the war torn North. Her aunt was caring for many other children and very often there was not enough food or other necessities of life. Another aunt invited her to join Life in Africa and this has changed her life by giving her money of her own.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She has been able to provide herself with a few things and has even been able to rent a small house for herself. She wisely invested her money in a business. She noticed that where she lived in the Kiwatule-Kampala area there were very few shops. So she opened a small shop and has managed to show a profit of 40,000 per month. This business is so promising that she now plans to expand in order to increase her profits.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;To do this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 250,000/= to purchase more stock for her shop. Based on her past experience she calculates that her profits will double. She will be able to repay this loan in 6 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Below are things she wants to add in her shop:&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;50kgs of sugar

Her mother sent her to an arts college and when she finished college she was given a sewing machine. From a very young age, she loved to sew. Therefore, Eva decided that she would continue with this line of work when she got older. Her customers come to her because she provides both quality and low prices. Eva and her husband take turns going to wholesalers to purchase things like fabric, thread, and utensils. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eva is on her second loan with Mifex. Her first loan went well as she was able to invest in buttons and fabrics.

She is the mother of seven children. Currently she lives in Kiwatule - Kampala and she is a very active member of Life in Africa. She joined Life in Africa five years ago and it has inspired her to work hard towards the visions and dreams she has for her family.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In the beginning she was confined to work at a place where she was not happy or fulfilled. She longed to be able to meet people she felt mattered the most to her. She was earning some money but deep inside she felt a longing for passion in her life and she wanted to reach out and help others. So she quit her job and came to work with Life in Africa full time. She discovered that she had abilities to be a leader and was quite good at social work and inspiring others, especially those in the IDP camps. She is currently the Director of Global Communities and Partnerships and she is a very respected leader.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;In 2006 she became one of the first loan recipients from KIVA. She used her loan money to expand her peanut butter business and was able to repay her loan in October of 2006 with only one late payment. Her business is doing well and provides a steady income for her family. But they are still living in a rented house and at the mercy of a landlord. She has a vision to change this by building a family home that will also include quarters that she can rent out to add more income each month.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She has been able to buy a plot of land in the suburb of kulabinro-Kampala and has been quite busy planning the home she wants to build. She calculates in will take 35,000 bricks to complete the project and she has already made and baked 28,000. She expects to have the construction money in June of 2007 so she feels she needs to get the remaining 7000 bricks done now. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 250,000/=. She will be able to repay this loan in 3 months using the profits from her peanut butter business.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Below is her budget:&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Labor for baking @................140,000/=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Labor for burning @...............50,000/=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Firewood @........................30,000/=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Water @...........................30,000/=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Total.............................250,000/=</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>150</funded_amount><paid_amount>150</paid_amount><image><id>42608</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Construction</activity><sector>Construction</sector><use>Buying firewood,water and paying labor.</use><location><country_code>UG</country_code><country>Uganda</country><town>Kulambiro,Kisasi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>2 33</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>8</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-12T05:50:35Z</posted_date><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Grace</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-26T09:16:16Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>150</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>150</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>50</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-26T09:15:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-26T09:15:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>35426</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-26T09:15:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-26T09:15:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>46358</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>50</amount><local_amount>50</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-26T09:15:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-26T09:15:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>50</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58652</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-12T09:16:16Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-09-26T09:15:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>11914</id><name>Rebecca</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rebecca Kibuka is an active member of Life in Africa.

She was able to make many sales during that time. Due to increased productivity, Beatriz is now able to sell her products in bulk to stores outside the city.

She and her husband sell ice on a roadside of this village and typically generate an average of about $5/day in revenue. In order to run this business properly, Phun N. is asking for $1000 in loan funds in order to purchase two ice boxes so that she can keep ice cool for a whole day.

Mrs Xuan is the leader of the group. The group has 8 members who are Ha, Thu, Loan, Toan, Gam, Tinh, Nu between 23 and 55 years old. They gather weekly so that they can save money and then rotate borrowing. In addtion, this can help them learn something by sharing experiences with each other and helping to repay loans. Average income is about $30/member/month. However, the loan from their savings is small so the loan doesn’t have enough for the members of the group. They want to borrow a loan of $500 for 8 members of group so that they will do small selling at local market, raising pigs at house, buying fertilizer for rice, cassava, and cashew nut trees. They hope the loan will help increase income. They will repay part of their loan every week.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>500</funded_amount><paid_amount>500</paid_amount><image><id>42633</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Agriculture</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>selling

Her husband works at the sheriff center and Hamida started her business in 2001 in order to support her family.  All year she sells tomatoes that she buys from local farmers and in August she sells maize and beans as they are being harvested.  She is the chairwoman of the local community self help group called Yetana (translates as &quot;supporting one another&quot;) which educates the locals on poverty eradication. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Twice a week, Hamida travels over 60 km to sell her produce on the busy route between Busia and Malaba.  With the loan of $ 150 from PEMCI, she plans to increase her tomato stock, and to also buy cereals during this harvest season to sell later. Hamida hopes that with an increase in profit she will be able to purchase a chicken and sheep to feed her family and sell eggs.

He started his business in 1997 when he realized there was unmet demand in his home village. He operates a retail shop.  His wife is a farmer. He has not undertaken any formal training concerning his business. Because there are very few shops in his village, Peter has access to customers from all-over the place.  He gets his stock from Malaba town centre where he goes once or twice per week according to the needs and demands of his customers.

He is 53 years old and lives with his wife and two children.  He trained as a medical doctor from 1974 to 1979 and initially worked with the government for 10 years. &lt;P&gt;In 1989 Dr. W. set up his own clinic in Machakos town (pictured). He offers a wide range of services including general curative services, family planning, and maternal and child health services. He also runs a pharmacy, a laboratory, and a theatre. &lt;P&gt;Dr. W. attributes his success to hard work, perseverance, and assistance from KMET’s previous two microfinance loans.

Since then, the school has grown to 156 children. The school takes children from nursery level to primary level (now in class 6). Out of the 156 children, 63 are orphans, some of whom Margaret has taken into her home. &lt;P&gt;Owing to increased enrollment in her school, Margaret requires US $ 1200 to renovate classrooms that

She and her husband live in Kisumu, Kenya.  &lt;P&gt;Christine was unable to complete her college studies due to family circumstances, and thus tried selling grains as her first business.  The cost of transportation, however, substantially limited her profits.  Shortly thereafter, she began her current business of selling second-hand clothes.  She specializes in women’s clothing: skirts, dresses, casual and formal tops, and is currently in the process of learning dress-making.  &lt;P&gt;Christine periodically travels to Nairobi, where she can purchase a large variety of clothes at wholesale prices.  The prime location of her business on a busy street, her eight years of experience there, and her friendly interaction with customers have enabled her to establish a good clientele base.  Her customers return to her shop for her wide selection and to make requests for certain styles.  Christine requires US $ 800 to expand her business and purchase additional clothing.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>42680</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

Kenya. He is married to two wives and has six children.  He was employed by the government for one year then worked at a private hospital for two years before starting his own practice in 1980 in Kisumu, Kenya.  He ran his initial facility for seventeen years. &lt;P&gt;Dr B. gradually focused his efforts on building an ultra-modern facility. With his small savings, plus 500,000 Kenyan Schillings (approximately US $7142) he received from KMET, he eventually shifted his clientele base to a more spacious facility in Kakamega, Kenya two and a half years ago.  Since then he has never looked back and is proud of his success. &lt;P&gt;To cope with a large increase in patients over the last two years, he has taken on an additional 12 staff members. His practice continues to grow as he attracts more corporate clients as well as private patients. He attributes his success to hard work, perseverance, and financial assistance from KMET. He has been able to expand his facility, increase the number of services he offers, and improve the quality of care he provides. To further expand his facility, he requires US $1200.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>42684</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Medical

She makes about $300 per month – a valuable source of income for her and her husband. Her husband has been struggling with illness which is a real concern for Antonina. She does her best to help him, and would like to see him completely recover.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Antonina has requested a loan for $800 to help her purchase more inventory.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Juan is married and has a one year old son. He used to work in a factory, but they let him go four years ago. Since money was tight and he had mouths to feed, Juan opened up his own business, which has become a local favorite in Guayaquil. In fact, whenever the Mifex team visits Ecuador, Juan (or “Nene” as he likes to be called) serves up the best dishes around.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He and his wife work seven days a week managing their restaurant which sells rice &amp; beans, beef, chicken, and chorizo. His wife Betty is the cook, and Nene attends to the clients. It wasn’t easy to start the restaurant because they didn’t have much capital. However, like many other Ecuadorian businesses, they started out by working from home in order to save money. Through perseverance, things have gone pretty well over the past four years. They have received such high demand that they had to build an extension to their home just to make space for more tables. Not only are customers coming from the local neighborhood, but from all around Guayaquil. Nene and Betty run the restaurant from 6:30 pm until 2:00 am.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Juan and Betty have made great progress with their business over the last several months with the help of a Mifex loan. The chairs and tables they bought were good investments as they allowed their customers to be more comfortable. They also used part of their money to buy meats in bulk. Their business has done so great that they are now offering lunch during the day as well. Juan and Betty&apos;s only problem now is that there is too much work and their kitchen and equipment cannot handle the load. They plan on using their next loan in order to purchase an industrial kitchen and continue making physical improvements to their restaurant.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>42747</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Buy

Her mother helps in her business. They are very diligent women. They started their business 7 years ago from crocheting and knitting headscarves and shawls. They sold their goods in the Yakshanbe and Chuma open-air bazaar. In 2003 Munirahon became a client of Micro Invest. With her loan, she rented a small shop in Avganbazaar.

They are the proud parents of three children, all in their teenage years.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;During the communist era, Dimitar worked in a textile factory for 14 years. He lost his job when it was privatized. Together, Dimitar and Milka started a small produce stand. The husband and wife team buy their produce from several small gardens around Sliven, as well as a large, regional produce warehouse when necessary. As the summer arrives here in Bulgaria, they are trying to expand their business by increasing the breadth of their offerings. This year, they aim to sell strawberries, apricots, peaches, and cherries, in addition to their usual summer catalog of eggplant, apples, and tomatoes. These fruits, however, are fairly expensive, and it will take several hundred dollars to have an inventory of each. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;This loan for $1,000 will enable Milka and Dimitar to purchase inventory as well as a small refrigerator for overnight

They have 5 children between the ages of 19 and 2. They have 5000 square meters of growing rice land but the land is very poor and they have no capital to buy fertilizer so productivity is low. Mrs. Thanh&apos;s  first son works as a daily laborer although he was admitted into a university. Her second, third and four children are going to school. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Thanh makes incense at her house and sells it at the local market. She also tends to her land.

He was able to begin his business thanks to his wife and kids, and some savings which he used to &#13;&#10;buy a perch and invest in merchandise. He’s been doing well. He works at his business every day of the week from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. His daughter is the one that attends to customers. His wife also helps the business develop by making weekly purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pablo would use the loan to invest in the purchase of other products that are unavailable at the store at the moment. He expects to sell products such as juices, ice cream and sodas. He has many orders from people from the neighborhood and he wants to be able to provide the service that they request. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pablo is married. He is 45 years old. He has four children of whom two work and help with household expenses. His house is built with a mixture of materials. He wishes to finish it one day – by saving little by little. His wish is to give his family a comfortable life. Everyone in his family do their best for the good of the house and the business.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Pablo tiene ya con su negocio 1 año, actividad que la inicio con la ayuda de su esposa y sus hijos. Con un dinero que tenía ahorrado compro una percha e invirtió en mercadería.   Le ha ido muy bien. Su negocio lo trabaja todos los días de la semana. Desde las 7 a.m. hasta las 9 p.m. Su hija es la que brinda la atención del negocio. Su esposa realiza las compras semanales y de esta manera también ayuda con el desarrollo del negocio. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Pablo el crédito lo invertirá en la compra de otros productos que no tiene al momento.  Además espera poner negocio de venta de jugos, helados, colas. Tiene pedidos de la gente del sector y  espera poder brindarle el servicio que le solicitan.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Pablo es casado. Tiene 45 años. Cuatro hijos de los cuales 2 trabajan y le ayudan en los gastos del hogar. Su casita es de construcción mixta. Espera poder poco a poco con sus ahorros terminarla. Su deseo es darle una vida cómoda a su familia. Todos aportan para el bien de la casa y del negocio.     &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>525</funded_amount><paid_amount>525</paid_amount><image><id>42939</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>General Store</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>invest in new products for his store</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Guayaquil</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.166667 -79.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-14T18:09:54Z</posted_date><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Pablo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-29T01:33:51Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>525</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>525</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-28T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>87.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>88</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-18T09:15:23Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>88</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33175</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>88</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-18T09:15:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>88</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43876</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>88</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-18T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>88</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55865</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>88</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-18T09:15:20Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>88</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68807</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>88</amount><local_amount>88</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-18T10:15:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>88</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>82924</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>85</amount><local_amount>85</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>85</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>98615</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-15T01:33:51Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-18T10:15:22Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>12065</id><name>Eyvi Areli</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>My name is Eyvi Manznares, and I have dedicated myself to producing sweet drinks with coconut milk for the past year.
