She sells duck eggs at the market and typically makes about $2.50/day in profit. Her husband is self-employed as a construction worker, and can help the family&apos;s finances from his daily wage. Her daughter works at a factory in the same city where her son works as a taxi driver. T. will use part of the loan to improve her business, by investing in more duck eggs to sell at the market. The rest of the loan will be used to repair her house which leaks during the rainy season. In the future, she plans to save enough money to own a stand at the market to sell not only duck eggs, but also a variety of grocery items.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>300</funded_amount><paid_amount>300</paid_amount><image><id>37528</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She has successfully finished her first loan.  Her first loan enabled her to increase and expand her retail shop. She has also started another business of selling cereals.  All her businesses are located at the community’s trading centre. She is a member of the local mosque’s women&apos;s group, which deals with enlightening women on their rights. She has been in business since 1988, thus she has gained quite an experience. With another loan from PEMCI, Zuleya wishes to increase her businesses’ stock further in order to meet her customers&apos; demand. Through her business, she has been able to support her husband who is also a businessman, and meet their family’s needs. She has also been able to bring services closer to the community and also contribute fully to her community’s women group. She has been an inspiration to other women in the

Her husband is not employed, and through her business she has been able to support her family and also buy some cattle to keep. She has also been able to develop her farm. She has also brought services closer to the community. With a loan from PEMCI, she intends to increase her stock and buy it in bulk, which will reduce time and costs given that she has to travel distances of over 500 kilometers once every

Her shop is located along the Malaba Uganda highway, hence her customers are mainly commuters.  The business is booming and this has enabled her to pay her loans promptly.  She wishes to get a larger loan in order to increase her cigarette stock.  She also intends to increase the stock of her new business of selling scrap metal.

S. is a 22 year-old, very busy mother of one child. She lives with her husband in Kampong Chnag province, Cambodia. She and her husband sell pork at a local market and usually make over $100/day in revenue. Instead of raising pigs, they purchase pork from wholesalers or from private owners of livestock. S. is requesting a loan of $1000 to help fund her business cycle and to buy more pork. This expansion to her business will raise her family&apos;s standard of living. She also plans to build a new concrete house in the

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Jeneth N. is 42 years old and is married. She has six children and looks after three orphaned dependents from her sister. She lives within the Kibera slums. Jeneth learned tailoring skills in 1995 through training at the Makina Market (a market area within Kibera with several businesses, including tailoring). After the training period was over, Jeneth continued to work at the place she was training in order to perfect her skills. She was later loaned Ksh 6,000 ($87) by her husband to start a tailoring business which she promised to pay after her business picks up. She has so far managed to settle this loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeneth currently hires a sewing machine for Ksh 1,000 (USD15) per month to use in her business. It is becoming increasingly expensive to hire and, worse still, the machine she hires may not always be in good condition and therefore she incurs extra expenses in doing the repairs. Jeneth currently operates her business from her home, as she is in the process of acquiring a rental place for her business.   &#13;&#10;&#9;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeneth now wants to acquire a machine of her own for independence. The cloth material and the machine will help to boost her business through attracting more customers to her stall, which is the place she desires to move to after acquiring the machine and the material in kind. Jeneth is hard working and determined to make her business successful. She does not believe in losing hope. She believes that the sky is the limit for her. She hopes to create job opportunities through employing people from her community to help in her stall. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Given a loan of USD 175, which is repayable within 8 – 14 months, Jeneth will acquire a sewing machine to support her business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>175</funded_amount><paid_amount>175</paid_amount><image><id>37846</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Tailoring</activity><sector>Services</sector><use>Purchase

She is a sharp businesswoman from Zaporoshye, Ukraine.  Over the last 7 years she has built a profitable business selling clothing – sweaters, shirts, t-shirts, and coats – as a market vendor. Her business is located in the Angolenko market,  a fairly new market that has heavy customer traffic. Many of Svetlana’s customers are retired. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Prior to owning her own business, Svetlana worked in a factory and had little experience with sales. She has learned much with running her own business and is more confident that she can reach her goal of maintaining a loyal clientele base who will continue to buy from her. &#13;&#10;Svetlana has requested a loan for $600 to buy inventory for the summer season. Her clothing inventory needs to be continually updated, especially for the summer months. The loan will give her additional funds to purchase new items and ensure that this summer will be another profitable season for her business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>37859</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>Purchase inventory for her clothing business</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Zaporozhye</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-28T03:01:21Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Svetlana</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-13T09:44:19Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-13T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-13T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T09:18:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27363</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-30T09:18:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>36872</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-30T09:19:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>48110</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-30T09:28:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>60662</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-30T10:19:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>73924</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>89025</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-30T09:44:19Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-30T10:31:19Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10757</id><name>Nik Mohammad</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nik M. lives in district 6 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

She began selling snacks in the streets but that required a lot of effort, so she decided with the help of her husband to adapt part of their house to sell lunches. A friend of theirs lent them the money with which they bought 1 table and 2 chairs.  Now, demand is growing. They work every day of the week between 8am and 3pm. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosaura would like a loan in order to buy provisions, so as not to have to buy them every day.  This would help her a lot, above all by allowing her to save time and money.  As well, she would like to allocate some capital to her husband so that he can begin to work. This would help the family’s income. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosaura is 36 years old, and has 4 children who study and help with the business. Currently, her husband works in the business, but his wish is to be able to start working for himself with the help of his wife.

Con esto estaría ayudando al ingreso del hogar.    &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosaura tiene 36 años. Y 4 hijos los que estudian y le ayudan en el negocio.

Working from his house, he managed to establish his own business thanks to huge effort and saving with his wife: in this way they’ve managed to maintain themselves, thanks to Amado’s constant dedication and his ability to find other sources of employment. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to the good quality of his work, the number of requests he receives has grown and because of this he needs a loan in order to buy more materials, particularly more wood and other accessories used in the construction and finish of the coffins.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Amado is 29 years old, he is married and his wife works with him, making the upholsteries for the coffins.  They don’t have any children at the moment, and the house they live in is made of cement and stable.  With this loan he hopes to improve his business and living conditions, and set a hard-working example for his relatives, who are continuing to taking advantage of the traditional teaching methods that their ancestors left them. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; Amado  tiene su negocio de elaboración de cajas mortuorias desde hace 7 años, actividad que aprendió de sus familiares.

to leave her home unattended and continue that line of work. Rosa now owns a small shop out of her home where she sells fruits, vegetables and other food items to the general public. This business has allowed her to maintain a close relationship with her 5 children while also bringing in a consistent flow of income. Her husband works as a shoe salesman in “La Bahia” the local tourist marketplace.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rosa was able to launch her business with only $100, but she is now in need of more capital in order to make it grow. She has decided not to borrow from loan sharks due to the very negative experiences close friends have had with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rosa has already borrowed from MIfex before. She invested the money in new products that she purchased at better prices and at larger quantities. She was able to increase the stock in her store in order to provide products on a more consistent basis. Prior to the loan she would have to buy a small amount of products day to day. The loan and the profits generated have given her the flexibility to buy products in larger quantities and reduce the amount of times that she has to travel to the larger markets to buy products.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rosa will use the new loan so she may purchase a freezer. The freezer will allow her to sell cold products, such as sodas, and also other perishable foods such as meat and chicken. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She has not been able to make any improvements to her home yet, but she has started saving with the aim to cement her floor, which is now mostly dirt and some pieces of wood. She looks forward to working with Kiva and Mifex in order to achieve her goals.

Q. de Machic, 56 years old, married to Héctor Machic Alvarado, 54 years old.  They have four sons and one daughter, aged 39, 32, 29, 28, and 27 years old.  Four of them are married and one is single.  Teresa has completed four loan cycles with Friendship Bridge, and has used her loans to purchase linen, curtains, and ceramics.  She buys the merchandise in Tapachula or Hidalgo City.  She is a leader in the San Felipe Retalhuleu community. &lt;p&gt; Teresa is very thankful to the Institution for her loans and the support given to her and her friends which has maintained unity in her loan group.  The talks given to them are very useful and keep her motivated.  &lt;p&gt;Teresa lost her father at the age of 7 and her mother when she was 13.  After this she went to live with her oldest sister, aged 45.  She comes from a very big family and is the youngest of 12 siblings.  When she was 8 years old she began to work at a refreshment stand cleaning tables and glasses because she was very small.  The owner of the refreshment stand had to buy her a stool for her to reach the tables and do her work.  She worked there for 2 years.  One evening her older sister hit her so Teresa ran away from home.  The police looked for her and found her but the abuse continued.  A lady named Greys, with whom she later worked doing laundry and ironing, took her in, so she only slept at her sister&apos;s home.  Later a school principal took her into her care.  The principal provided her with room and board, clothes, and made sure she was able to stay in school.  In return she cleaned the principal&apos;s house.  This way she was able to complete the 6th grade of elementary school.  At age 16 she got married and her first child when she was 17.  She was a single mother for 6 years.  When she was 21 years old she married Hector and has had a happy life with him. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Ari Vilhjalmsson, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;TERESA RUTH D.

She is a farmer cultivating and growing crops in a field behind her house. With crop growing, Uch M. makes very little money for  the household, but to increase the family savings Chay Heng, her husband, who is a head of family, helps by working as a construction foreman. Four of her children attend school, and the other one works in a garment factory and contributes that salary to financing the household. Uch M. is asking for a $1000 loan to purchase a piece of land to grow more crops for additional income. In the future, if the family savings increase, she hopes to have enough money to open a grocery store at the

She sells fruit at the side of the road and normally makes around $5/day in revenue. Her husband, meanwhile, is self-employed as a motor-taxi driver and typically contributes his daily income to the family savings. One of this couple&apos;s children works at the nearby local garment factory, and the two others are enrolled in school. S. is asking for a $1000 loan to purchase a passenger cart to be attached to her husband&apos;s motorcycle and make it a tuk-tuk, a motorcycle taxi. She thinks this can make additional income. In the future, S. would like to have enough money to invest in a grocery business rather than selling fruit at the roadside.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>37996</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Taxi</activity><sector>Transportation</sector><use>To

X., 24 years old.  She and her husband have a little girl.  She is from San Pedro Yepocapa.  Her parents are both alive and her mother is an admirable, hardworking client of ours.  Marta is very active and is the head of her loan group.  She is a woman who strives to improve her own life and that of her family.  She already has a small business, a Convenience Store, situated close to the Catholic church of Ypocapa. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Marta is a young woman but she has had her share of problems.  Her first baby is now 3 years old but unfortunately her second baby was stillborn about one year ago.  She says she is very sad about this great loss, after suffering through pregnancy to have such a tiny being slip out of her hands.  But she is slowly recovering. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;She has goals for her business in order to improve her family&apos;s life.  Her husband is a bricklayer and they are saving up to build their own home.  She is very thankful to her mother for helping her with her own business.  Seeing as her mother is also an entrepreneur, she is able to guide and support her daughters, especially Marta.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Marta knows how to use her loans, and is confident that she does things correctly to make her husband and daughter proud.

During the week she cleans house for a particular family, and on Saturdays and Sundays she sells vegetables in the market. She buys them from a cousin who has a garden, and if her cousin doesn’t have vegetables on a given day, she buys them from farmers who bring their produce to sell in the city. Benita doesn’t have a fixed place—she sells her produce in an unoccupied spot in the market. With the loan, she would like to buy a place in the market from which to sell her vegetables, so that she won’t have to work cleaning a house anymore. She is part of the “Ecatepec Group 1”. &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;BENITA TIENE 19 AÑOS, CASADA, DURANTE LA SEMANA SE DEDICA A LIMPIAR UNA CASA PARTICULAR Y LOS SABADOS Y DOMINGOS VENDE VERDURAS EN EL MERCADO, ESTO LO COMPRA CON UNA PRIMA DE ELLA QUE TIENE HORTALIZA, Y SI UN DADO CASO NO TIENE NADA DE COSECHA LO COMPRA CON GENTE DE LAS COMUNIDADES QUE TRAEN VERDURAS PARA VENDERLAS A LA CIUDAD. ELLA NO TIENE LOCAL, VENDE SUS PRODUCTOS EN ALGUN LUGAR DESOCUPADO DEL MERCADO. CON EL PRESTAMO QUISIERA COMPRAR UN LUGAR AHI PARA VENDER SUS VERDURAS Y ASI NO TENER QUE TRABAJAR MAS EN CASA PARTICULAR.

He sells groceries in downtown Kamenka-Dneprovskaya. His kiosk is located in a very busy place which is why there are always many customers who come to buy groceries from Alexei. He is a hard worker and works long days to make sure his family has everything they need.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alexei has been running this kiosk for three years. Presently, his gross income is about $2,600 a month. He has around $2,200 in inventory. Lending services from “Nadiya Ukraine” have promoted the expansion of his small venture. Recently, Alexei started attending a Christian church. This has had a positive effect on his trade and helped him be more customer-friendly. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alexei’s business is the only source of income for his family. He realizes this responsibility and is doing his best to meet the needs of his young wife and little daughter. Today he is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase a new refrigerator to keep the meat he sells in his kiosk fresh. Alexei is hoping that one day he will be able to generate enough profit to open his own little grocery store.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>38058</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She has a small store run out of her house.  She also sells baked chicken.  Saturday and Sunday afternoons she prepares tacos, chalupas, empanadas, and tamales.

She is an experienced gardener who knows important secrets for growing healthy vegetables and fruit. She owns a little kiosk where she sells seeds and fertilizers in the market at Kamenka-Dneprovskaya, which is in a large farming area. Yuliya has been in this business for 10 years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yuliya’s customers know that she can always give good advice on how to plant seeds and look after plants. This keeps them coming back to her kiosk to get everything they need for the spring gardening season – and some practical tips, too. Eight loans from “Nadiya Ukraine” have promoted the growth of Yuliya’s business. Today, as the result of financial assistance, she is the happy owner of a spacious and comfortable vending facility in the central town market. She currently has about $4,000 gross income every month. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yuliya would like to get a loan for $1,000 to purchase a variety of seeds and fertilizers that will help her increase her clientele and profitability as a result. We believe her ability to follow innovations in farming and gardening and her desire to constantly improve her skills prove she is a dedicated entrepreneur who will succeed despite any difficulties or competition she may face.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>38065</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farm

He is always looking to grow and develop his business and improve his entrepreneurial skills. He is very ambitious and determined and is a leader in his community. Currently, Anatolyi’s monthly gross business income is about $5,000.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anatolyi is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase some new equipment for his store and increase his inventory. He believes that offering high quality products in combination with the best customer service is a win-win strategy for both his customers and himself as a businessman.

She owns a small business selling women’s clothing in one of the local markets in Stryi. She has one hired employee. Galina has been in this trade for nine years. Currently, she has about $2,000 worth of inventory in stock. Her monthly gross profit is about $1,000. Her net profit amounts to $300. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Galina is very enthusiastic about her business. One of the biggest attractions of her business is the reasonable prices she offers. Credit services from “Nadiya Ukraine” have been a help to her as she has developed her trade. She has been a partner with “Nadiya Ukraine” for three years. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Galina would like to receive a loan for $1,200 to purchase 20 women’s suits, pants and skirt sets. She is planning to increase the variety of classic and trendy suit styles she has for sale in her kiosk so she can fit every working woman. The funds will allow her to maintain an adequate amount of inventory on hand and easily update her product selection. We believe that this loan will continue to help her business be successful and provide much needed income for Galina and her family. Moreover, it will help Galina generate the capital needed to start a new venture she is planning – to open a grocery kiosk in the local food market.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>38069</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing Sales</activity><sector>Clothing</sector><use>To purchase 20 women’s suits, pants and skirt sets</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Stryi</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>49 32</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-01T19:13:49Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Galina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-18T17:37:09Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-08T09:18:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>30253</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-08T09:18:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>40307</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-08T09:19:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52131</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-08T09:20:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64719</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:21:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78298</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93547</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-04T17:37:09Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-08T10:22:54Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10826</id><name>Nina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Nina is married with three grown children. After finishing her education she worked for a while in a kindergarten school. Today she runs a small business selling baked goods and confectionery in the central market. Her business boasts a wide assortment of fresh inventory at reasonable prices. Nina has been in this trade for 10 years. Her monthly gross income is about $6,000. She makes about 30-40% profit on the goods she sells.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nina works long hours to keep her business sustainable and growing. The 10 loans that she has received and promptly repaid with “Nadiya Ukraine” have helped to ensure the consistent and stable expansion of her business. Nina’s customers are always satisfied with the quality of the products she sells in her little kiosk. She manages to keep fresh groceries even when the heat is at its worst and food products can easily spoil.   &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nina is requesting a loan of $1,000 to help purchase a new vending kiosk. She believes that a new location will be more convenient for her customers and will increase her business income. We think that her natural ability to cheer people up with a word of encouragement or a smile will also help attract potential new clients and boost her sales as a result.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>38070</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To purchase a vending kiosk</use><location><country_code>UA</country_code><country>Ukraine</country><town>Kamenka-Dneprovskaya</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>47.485278 34.405833</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>26</partner_id><posted_date>2007-06-01T19:13:51Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Nina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-18T23:27:18Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1000</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1000</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-18T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-18T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>166.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-08T09:18:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>30254</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-08T09:18:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>40308</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-08T09:19:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>52132</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-08T09:20:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>64720</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>167</amount><local_amount>167</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-08T10:21:57Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>167</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>78299</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>165</amount><local_amount>165</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>165</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>93548</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-06-04T23:27:18Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-08T10:22:55Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10827</id><name>Yevgenyi</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Yevgenyi is married and has one son.

When her husband passed away, the oldest child was 17, and even though Teresa was working for a company it was not sufficient to cover the expenses of the home and the school fees of the children. For that reason she decided to start her own business selling food. After a short time, she changed it to selling shoes and new and used clothing. Fortunately, her customers and her income have both increased. Thanks to Teresa&apos;s work, her oldest son has now finished his studies, and she hopes the rest can too.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In order to keep her business growing, Teresa is requesting a loan in the amount of $475, which she will use to buy merchandise with the goal of offering better service to her customers and new buyers.

Rosa and her husband Jose Antonio are blessed with three sons: Jose Rodolfo (7), Jose Rodrigo (5) and Jose Daniel (3).  Rosa buys her fish early in the morning from the fisherman near her home and marinates them in the morning so that she will have plenty of seasoned fish to fry by lunchtime. Specifically, her loan will allow her to buy a scale to weigh the fish, a cooler to keep them fresh and, of course, more fish.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Rosa Maria is a member of an Esperanza solidarity group -- part of their Bank of Hope they have named &quot;El Liberación&quot;.

An average of eight to ten people eat at her store for lunch every day.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>450</funded_amount><paid_amount>450</paid_amount><image><id>38106</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Restaurant</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Purchase a freezer and some beverages for her restaurant.</use><location><country_code>DO</country_code><country>Dominican Republic</country><town>Samana</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>19.25 -69.45</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-05-29T17:27:19Z</posted_date><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Claudia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-06-12T19:41:20Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>450</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>450</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-12T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-12T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-12-12T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-02-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>125</amount><local_amount>125</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-03T20:54:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>125</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>28711</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-12T09:24:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>41851</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-12T09:22:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>53634</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-12T09:21:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>66386</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-12T10:24:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>80388</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>75</amount><local_amount>75</local_amount><processed_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>75</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>95831</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-05-29T19:41:20Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-12-12T10:25:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>10848</id><name>Diehna</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Diehna M.

She uses her Esperanza loan to buy products such as pots and pans, which she then sells to other people. They pay her back in incremental payments while she then pays back Esperanza as she receives payments from her customers.  Diehna keeps a detailed accounting book of all her clients and how much they owe -- a record-keeping tool reflecting the method used by Esperanza for tracking payments of associates. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Diehna is one of five micro-entrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their shares of this $750 loan together. If a member is unable to pay in full and on time, the group is responsible for making up the deficit before a payment can be made. This group-lending method strengthens social needs in a community and ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and

Although she has not undertaken any training pertaining to the business she does, she has learnt from doing.  She gets her stock from farmers during harvest season when the product is abundant, and stores the excess to sell later when supply is low.  Through her business, she has acquired experience.  Five of her chidren have finished schooling while the rest are still in school.  With a loan from PEMCI, Reginata wishes to increase her cereal stock  to meet the mounting demands of her customers.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>38258</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Grocery

In a day Sopiah can earn $10. She needs a loan of $50. With this loan, she will buy more goods to sell in her store, and thus more or less double her income.

Rusmini and her husband, Empuh, buy waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Households do not just give away waste material because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. With more capital, they can purchase more scrap to recycle. Rusmini and her husband are the first link in this chain, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted  material and takes it to the warehouse dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of Rusmini’s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste materials to various processing factories which in turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by Rusmini and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills. In a day Rusmini can earn $60. She needs a loan of $75. With this loan, she can buy more waste material and thus more or less double her income. Rusmini very much wants to earn more money for her childrens’ education and to give them a better life.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>75</funded_amount><paid_amount>75</paid_amount><image><id>38278</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>to

games just as they do in the rest of the world. Businesses like Barbara’s have emerged that rent playing time on video game consoles from home. Barbara has three TVs and three Playstations with a variety of games that the kids can choose from. She saved up $500 from her part time job in a travel agency to buy the used consoles and televisions. Barbara also sells ice cream and soft drinks to the video game players and kids from a nearby school, and other items such as clothing and makeup.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Barbara planned to use her first loan to increase her inventory of  shirts and cosmetics, and eventually save up to buy a new console. She had a setback when a television was stolen from her home. Therefore she did not invest in the console but instead continued diversifying her sales. She is seeking the loan in order to invest clothing and cosmetics.

She opens her salon at 9 in the morning and works until about 8 p.m. She already has lent from Kiva and Mifex.

She invested in various items that helped her improve her hair styling business.

He will then sell the fish at the market, at a local auction and by traveling to remote villages. He will be able to make 90,000=/ profit on each basket he buys. This, along with his other income, will allow him to repay the loan and will help to provide school fees for his children.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;To accomplish this he is asking for a loan in the amount of 230,000=/ and he will be able to repay this loan in 6 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Business plan:&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;1 license ..........................Ush 25,000/=p/year&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;2 Seeing doctor.....................Ush 5,000/=p/ year.

She takes care of the 4 orphans of her eldest brother. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ms. K. has been in rice agriculture for 4 years and currently owns a small plot of land with palm trees (she uses the nuts to make red oil and other products.) She doesn’t own her own plot of land for rice agriculture, so even though she does all of the work for 5 plots of rice, she is paid very low wages for sprouting the plants, planting them in the plots, weeding them and taking care of them for 4 months, and then harvesting them. Since she has almost no profit from all of her work, Ms. K. wants to buy land with other members of her solidarity group to divide amongst them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Ms. K.&apos;s group will purchase about 5-10 hectares so that each woman will have ½ a hectare to herself. She is a very responsible woman who has been trusted to take care of the local church, including all of its funds, and can therefore be trusted with a loan. She also supports her son while he is in medical school and she is hoping to one day be able to help him start his own practice.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Having only completed elementary school, Ms. K. finds it very difficult to make enough money to care for her family. She lives in her father’s house with her children and cannot afford to properly feed them. Two of the children are in school, 2 are apprentices, and one left his apprenticeship and is currently unemployed. Some days she eats only a very small amount of beans to last her through the whole day of hard labor and she buys corn on credit in order to help feed the children in her home. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ms. K. cannot afford to pay for a doctor’s visit or for the medicine from a pharmacy, so she is forced to buy unregulated medicine sold on the streets when someone is ill. She cannot even afford to purchase boots in order to work in the water-drenched rice fields filled with worms that bite at her legs, so she simply wraps her feet in cloth.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Ms. K. is a very trustworthy woman and this loan will help her to be able to make a more decent living and to better care for her family’s needs.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>38583</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Ms.

She has been in rice agriculture since 2002 as a hired hand, and hopes to be able to purchase her own plot of land. As a side business, she also prepares “gari” (a food derived from the cassava root that is often eaten with beans) in order to sell in the markets or to women who come from the city to purchase it at low prices.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Even though Mrs. A. has her certificate in accounting, she is currently forced to work for very low wages as a hired hand in the rice fields. Receiving this loan would allow Mrs. A. to work for herself and to take better care of her family.  Her two eldest children are in school and the 3 youngest have not yet begun. Since her husband pays little attention to her and the family’s needs, she has moved into her father’s home with the children. She is almost solely responsible for their needs since her husband only helps to pay the school fees for the children. She is not able to feed her family more than twice a day, and the meals are not very substantial. She also cannot afford to go to the hospital, so she relies on herbal remedies and unregulated medicine when there is an illness.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. A. is currently asking for her first loan of $1,000 in order to purchase 5 square plots of land as part of a larger plot of land to be purchased by her solidarity group. She will use the land to plant rice and will repay her loan in 12 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. A. is a very hard working woman who knows how to cultivate rice and this loan will be a great source of joy and allow her to improve her family’s standard of living.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>38586</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Mrs.

Her main business is corn and cassava agriculture, and she also makes “gari” (a food derived from the cassava root that is often eaten with beans) in order to sell.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. A. currently works 1 hectare of land that belonged to her father, and needs additional funding in order to be able to plant in the 3 other hectares available to her.  She is asking for a $600 loan in order to be able to plant again next season and to increase her crop size, and she plans to repay the loan in 12-15 months. She was able to plant her first crop with the help of a loan from another microfinance institution that is no longer working in her area, and so she is grateful that Microfund Togo is now coming to help them.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Mrs. A. attended an English school in neighboring Ghana, but had to leave after elementary school since the money had run out. She currently lives in what was her father’s home with her two grandchildren since there is no one else there. With her increased crop and income, she is hoping to improve her health and to better care for the children that she cares for. Mrs. A. is a very hard-working woman, even at her age, and will be able to make good use of her loan.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>38588</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cereals</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Mrs.

He began working in agriculture by helping his parents, first by raising pigs, and then with rice. He was able to plant his first plot on rented land with a loan from his father, but this year he did not have the necessary funds to plant, and therefore had to leave his plot empty until the next harvest.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loan and his income will allow Mr. T. to better care for his children’s education, both are currently in school.

Although she is illiterate and was never able to attend school, Mrs. D. is currently able to send the child in her charge to school and to pay for the school fees. They live in her uncle’s home, however, and cannot afford to go to the doctor or to eat substantial meals.

His first goal is to start a brick making business. Bricks are in good demand during the building season. A loan of 250,000=/ will make this goal a reality plus he will be able to proivide some income for others.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to make 8000 bricks.

This becomes difficult because she is the only one to meet these needs but she is determined that as long as she has her health she will continue to do just that. However, she and her children share a great love for each other and they have learned that if they are to survive they all have to work together, and each child is doing their part to help sustain the family.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She intends to get a loan of 250,000= to invest in buying produce and selling in Cere-leno Market were she been doing the same though in small scale.

Irine&apos;s mum died of poison in the year 2001. Currently she is living with an uncle in the Pece division of Gulu town.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Irine is single and currently employed part time with Life in Africa as the Breakfast Club tea girl at WE Center Gulu. The Breakfast Club is for night commuter children, who walk each night to the center to sleep for fear of being abducted by rebel forces. Irine is a hard working lady who makes sure that every child at the center gets breakfast each morning.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;With her loan, Irine plans to establish a public pay phone. The phone will be located on Awich Road, plot 23 adjacent to Mola Clinic. She has contracted a lady who will be operating the business and she will pay her a monthly salary equivalent to 10% of the profit. She will be using UTL as the service provider because the cost per unit charged is relatively lower than other service providers.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;She expects to make a profit worth over 200,000/= per month. She believes that the business will have a great impact on her life by empowering her economically with enough income to sustain her own basic needs and help others.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Irine expects to refund the loan after a period of 6 months.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Below is her budget plan:&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Fixed line phone...............................120,000=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Airtime.............................................100,000=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Rent................................................15,000=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Labor................................................15,000=&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Total 250,000=&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;*Please note -

His plan is to add a pay phone next to his wife&apos;s business.&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;He expects to raise their income with a 30,000/= profit from the phone every week.

She has been in business for three years and has proven to be a very sharp business owner. In those three years she has expanded from one to four sales locations. She now employs three salespeople, and her husband, Valeriy, also helps with the business. There is not a lot of competition for Evgeniya’s products, as is often the case with many other market vendors. This has allowed her to earn a little more income and afford to expand. At one location, she was able to purchase a storage container rather than rent another facility. She is now able to invest more money in the business instead of paying rent. Another way she has been able to save money is to buy inventory directly from manufacturers rather than from middlemen suppliers.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Evgeniya has requested a loan to help her purchase an additional sales kiosk. She found one not far from one of her other kiosks that she’d like to use to grow her business even further. Evgeniya loves what she is doing and is looking forward to the future. She and her husband are grateful for the opportunity this business has given, not only to provide for themselves, but also to help their children and grandchildren.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>38991</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase

Olga loves what she does which shows in how she conducts her business. With her friendly smile and helpful service, she makes customers feel appreciated, and they want to come back and buy from her again. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Olga is married with two children, a son who is 25 and a daughter who is 19. One of the things she enjoys about having her own business is the opportunity help her children financially. She is currently helping both with their education expenses.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Olga has requested a loan to help her purchase needed inventory so she can keep up with demand. Obtaining products in a timely manner can be difficult sometimes for businesses like Olga’s, due to problems with suppliers and shipping. This funding will make it easier for Olga to maintain her available inventory so she can continue to offer excellent service to her customers.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>39006</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase

We have three children, and a home with only one room is too small for our family. Which is why I&apos;m requesting a loan of $500 so we&apos;re able to put up a roof over the two rooms so we can live more comfortably.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Tengo mas de un año que adquirí la vivienda era solo un cuarto cundo no la entregaron poco a poco mi esposa y yo hemos juntado para hacer los muros de dos cuartos pero por cosa del destino no hemos podido terminarla, tenemos 3 hijos y la casa de un cuarto es demasiado pequeña para la familia.

Sorn S. sells ice-cream to people in his village--a wonderful treat in the hot weather!  He can usually earn about $12 per day from this business activity.  His wife (who is pictured here), meanwhile, stays at home to watch their children.  The couple hopes to use this loan to repair their home in order to protect it from leaking during the rainy season.  In the future, Sorn S.&apos;s wife would like to open a small grocery store in the village.  Eventually, they hope to build a concrete house for the family.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1000</funded_amount><paid_amount>1000</paid_amount><image><id>39217</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

She grows crops and sells fish on the roadside of this village. From this business activity, she typically makes around $2.5/day in revenue, while her husband is a motor-taxi driver who helps to generate the family&apos;s savings with the money he daily makes. Additionally, S. hopes to use the loan to purchase a pumping machine in order to supplement  her crop growing and part of money is to dig a well to supply water. Eventually, she not only hopes to save enough money to purchase two or three cows to help in her field, but to provide her children a good quality of education one
