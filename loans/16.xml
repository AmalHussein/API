The passing away of her supportive father and brother within one year, coupled with continuous difficulties to raise capital, caused her to take a friend’s advice to take a loan. On completion of the Minimum Skills Workshop organized by GHAPE for first-time borrowers, she received her first loan in 2003. Her performance earned trust and she was later elected to a leadership position, Centre Chief of her center. With previous loans she succeeded in providing her community with good quality raw foodstuff. She is proud of having contributed financially in paying school fees for her children. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $800, she plans to increase her stock by buying beans, &lt;i&gt;garri&lt;/i&gt; and potatoes. She is convinced that her business will succeed because of her marketing skills, the available market provided by the ever increasing population of the Bamenda urban center, her business site, and the availability and advantages of liquidity. She plans to repay the loan in 18 months. The first installment repayment shall be on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of loan.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>24936</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Trading </use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Musang, Bamenda, NW.

Anna</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Born in 1974, Anna has custody of her four children and the six children of her two late brothers.  After separating from her husband, it was out of necessity that Anna had to engage in income-generating activities. In her desperation, her neighbor encouraged her to join GHAPE. With peer support and management skills acquired she succeeded in managing her previous loans. She is proud of having provided food to her community continuously.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $800, she plans to increase her stock by buying 240-liters of palm oil, 2 bags of koki beans, and second-hand dresses and bed-sheets.  She will bring these items closer to members of her community. She plans to get her children involved for two reasons: to assist her and to stay out of trouble. She plans to pay loan in 18 months. The first installment repayment shall be on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>800</funded_amount><paid_amount>800</paid_amount><image><id>24943</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>Trading </use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Ndamukong, Bamenda, NW.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Absalon has worked in the production and sales of frames and mirrors for 8 years. He began learning the trade from another person 20 years ago. Upon his release from his work with that person he decided to frame a print of a painting and offer it for sale. He sold it to a friend. This moved him to open his own business. Using his savings, and a loan, he was able to rent a space where he began to buy printed works, mount them and then sell the framed paintings. His business grew to the point that he had as many as six people working for him, selling the frames that he created. Unfortunately, competition came to the area. He began manufacturing mirrors, which worked out well for him. Currently, he produces both products without any help, aside from his son who now paints frames. He works seven days a week from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. His shop is located in his home. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;Absalon would like to obtain a loan to invest in the production of mirrors which he has stopped making due to his lack of funds. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;Absalon is married. He is 40 years old and has 4 children, one of which has begun to assist him in the production of the painting frames. His wife works as a homemaker. With the investment, he would like to once again engage salesman, allowing him to better his business.  &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Absalon tiene una experiencia de 8 años en el negocio de fabricación y venta de cuadros y espejos, actividad que la aprendió por medio de una  persona desde hace 20 años. Una vez que se abrió de dicha persona para la que trabajaba decide elaborar un cuadro y salirlo a vender el que se lo vendió a un amigo. Esto lo impulso a tener ya su negocio propio. Con los ahorros que tenia y un crédito logra alquilar un local donde comienza la elaboración de cuadros. Llego a tener hasta seis personas a su cargo que eran los que les vendían los cuadros que el elaboraba. Lamentablemente llego la competencia por lo que decide elaborar espejos con los que le fue muy bien. Al momento elabora los dos productos pero sin ayudantes, solo su hijo que ya pinta los cuadros. Trabaja todos los días de la semana en horario de 8 a.m. hasta las 8 p.m. Tiene el taller ubicado en su domicilio.    &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Absalon desea el crédito para poder invertir en la elaboración de espejos los cuales ha dejado de fabricar por falta de capital. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Absalon es casado. Tiene 40 años y 4 hijos de los cuales uno ya le ayuda en la elaboración de sus cuadros. Su esposa se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar.  Su deseo es poder con la inversión que hace lograr incluir nuevamente a vendedores que le ayuden a mejorar su negocio.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>24950</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Furniture Making</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>Purchase of materials and equipment to begin producing mirrors again.</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Guayaquil</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-2.166667 -79.9</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T17:07:46Z</posted_date><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Absalon</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T08:23:55Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>600</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>600</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>100</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-17T09:15:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23728</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-17T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32853</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-17T09:15:28Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43527</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-17T09:15:22Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55493</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>100</amount><local_amount>100</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>100</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68338</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T08:23:55Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-17T09:15:12Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>7620</id><name>Mirabel Manka</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Born in 1986, Mirabel is a mother of two, having had her first child at fourteen when she dropped out of school for lack of sponsorship.

He has not forgotten when thieves visited him and when the Urban Council confiscated vehicles from his garage at a time he was greatly struggling to build it with loans from GHAPE. However, he decided to forge ahead in the belief that obstacles will always be there but life has to continue. Festus is a fourth-time borrower. From his three previous loans he provided mechanic services to car owners in his community. He is proud of owning a functioning garage.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given a loan of $800, he plans to buy old cars and spare parts and service some of the old cars in his garage. He is convinced that he will succeed because of lessons from the past, the quality of his work, and the ever-increasing customers resulting from the bad roads. His dream is to expand his garage and provide apprenticeships to other young people.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;He plans to pay loan in 18 months.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Rosalba is a single mother of two children. She lives with her mother and father on their lands, after being left by her husband just a year ago. Despite the difficult situation, Rosalba wants to get ahead by investing this loan on her parents land. Since she was young she has been living off of the rice production from the farm, and she is now looking to make investments that will help her family keep more profits. She hopes that with the loan she will one day have a home of her own for her and her children, ages 5 and 1. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Rosalba is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

The plot of land she owns was given to her by her parents, whom she still works closely with. On her farm she primarily grows rice, but she also raises cattle and chickens. Whenever she can, she ventures into the larger markets of the city to sell the animals or the rice from her farm. She is optimistic about having a source of investment capital for her production because she will be able to afford seeds and fertilizer that will increase her productivity. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mercedes is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Julio has lived on his lands for about 40 years. He has 6 children, all of whom are grown. Some of his sons still work with him on the farm during the heavy cycles of rice production. He has depended on his lands for his entire life. He also has some cattle that he raises and uses for milk production. Julio will invest the loan mainly in pesticides and the rental of machinery to pick the rice he has already planted. The loan will help increase his profits as he will not lose as much production as before and it will be easier to collect his product.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Julio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Manuel is a farmer in the Santa Lucia County, where he has lived for twenty years. He is 63 years old, but he still has the will to work and provide for his family. He has a 14 year-old that he wants to make sure finishes school. Manuel is hoping to receive the loan in order to improve the production of his lands. He will primarily buy fertilizer and fumigation equipment. He and his wife Benita hope to save for the future of their son. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Manuel is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

Although his farm is small, it has been providing for him and his family for over 30 years. He is now seeking to make an investment in order to reap more benefits from the land. He wants to invest in fertilizers and pesticides in order to better care for his main crop, rice. William and his family also raise pigs and chicken on their farm, only selling them when they are in need of money. William has his rice processed and commercialized at his associations facilities, where he also works part time.   &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; William is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

To them, the &quot;hacienda&quot; is more than a home, as it has been in the family for over 40 years and it also puts food on the table.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Dionicio has lived in Santa Lucia for about 50 years. As most of the other people in the sector, he has gone through life thanks to the fertile lands that produce rice. He has raised 5 children thanks to the help of his rice farming. He is now hoping that he can receive a loan in order to improve his farm and leave his children with more productive lands. He has had 5 children in total and he is happy that they have grown up but still help him on the family&apos;s farm.  &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;The Santa Lucia Communal Bank&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; Dionicio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as &lt;i&gt;boleo&lt;/i&gt; in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;

<name>Numfor Tabitha</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Tabitha is a single mother of three. She attended medical school and also training on pig farming. There is high demand for her services from her neighbors who cannot pay for public consultation fees. In addition, most of her neighbors collect the droppings of the pigs for manure on their farms.  This increases food yields there and reduces hunger and malnutrition. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;However she was prevented from operating a big medicine store because of finances. With loans from GHAPE, she opened a small store and bought piglets. Profit from the business helped her to fit doors and widows in her building. With high demand from the community, there is need for expansion.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Given $500, she is prepared to expand this business and buy more medicine together with four piglets and eight bags of feed. This will enable her to earn more profit to educate her children.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>600</funded_amount><paid_amount>600</paid_amount><image><id>25184</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Retail</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Pharmacy and pig farming</use><location><country_code>CM</country_code><country>Cameroon</country><town>Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

Her family is going through financial crisis, so she decided to help her husband by starting an Embroidery Business. With her first loan of $175, she will buy an embroidery machine and more fabrics in order to be able to produce more stock and expand her business.

A. is married, has four children and lives in District 5 of Kabul City. She was in high school when the war broke out and that kept her from completing her education. The wars had a very bad impact on her financial situation and her life got worse day by day. In order to improve her family&apos;s finances, she took out her first loan to buy clothes for her sons to sell in the market and streets of Kabul City. Before the loan, only one of her sons was doing business, which made it difficult to overcome their financial problems. Her first loan made it possible to buy more clothes so two of her sons could work and earn money. She is requesting a second loan of $175 so she and her sons can continue to increase their income and opportunities to do business.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>175</funded_amount><paid_amount>175</paid_amount><image><id>25638</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Clothing

She also takes care of her elderly mother. She started her business five years ago, sewing and selling costume jewelry. She chose this work because it allowed her to have a more flexible schedule, so she could spend more time with her mother and take better care of her children. Both of her children are studying and they help María in any way that they can.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lately, María&apos;s has had more work as well as more demand for her products. This is why she needs a $275 loan; she&apos;ll use the money to buy more costume jewelry and material she needs to continue sewing. María would like to see her business grow, because this means a better support for her family and that her children will be able to finish their studies. She needs your support and is sincerely thankful to you for any help you can offer her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Translated from Spanish by Isabel Tan, a Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;La señora Maria es madre soltera de una hija de 16 años y un hijo de 15,  además se hace cargo de su mamá que es una persona de edad avanzada.  Desde hace cinco años se dedica al negocio de costura y a la venta de bisutería, por que esto lo podía realizar en horarios más flexibles, que le permitieran pasar más tiempo con su madre y atender mejor a sus hijos. Sus dos hijos están estudiando y colaboran con el negocio de Maria en lo que les es posible.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Últimamente para Maria el trabajo se ha incrementado, igual que la demanda por sus productos, por lo que requiere de un préstamo por la cantidad de $ 275 dólares que empleara en la compra de mercancía de bisutería y artículos que requiere para la costura. Maria tiene muchos deseos de crecer porque sabe que de esta manera podrá ayudar a su familia, y sus hijos podrán concluir sus estudios, es por eso que necesita de tu apoyo y agradece sinceramente cualquier ayuda que puedas ofrecerle.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>275</funded_amount><paid_amount>275</paid_amount><image><id>25712</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Decorations Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Compra de mercancía </use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Sabinas Hidalgo, Nuevo León</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>23 -102</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T17:52:52Z</posted_date><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maria</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T17:40:03Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>275</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>275</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>68.75</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>138</amount><local_amount>138</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:16:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-16T09:16:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>138</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23527</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>69</amount><local_amount>69</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:16:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-16T09:16:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>69</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32636</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>68</amount><local_amount>68</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:16:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-08-16T09:16:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>68</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43215</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T17:40:03Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-08-16T09:16:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>7980</id><name>Zaur</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Zaur P.

She is married and has two daughters who are 22 and 24 years old. Eleven years ago, Jacinta began selling food in order to help her husband with household expenses and her daughters’ schooling. Her husband is a laborer and the income he received was very little. She began with a small stove and just a few kitchen implements, but her business has grown and, little by little, she has been improving her kitchen and he has gained the liking of her clients. Both of her daughters now help her and she wishes to see her business grow. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;At this time, Jacinta needs a loan in the amount of $700.00, which she will use to buy ingredients she needs to make the foods she sells. Become a part of the growth of this business and help this family make it grow. You can collaborate with them, have no doubts. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Jacinta es originaria de Mérida, Yucatán, es casada y tiene dos hijas, de 22 y 24 años. Hace once años que Jacinta inició con la venta de comida para poder ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y con los estudios de sus hijas, porque él es obrero y el salario que recibía era muy poco. Inició con una pequeña estufa y con pocos accesorios, pero su negocio ha ido creciendo y poco a poco ha ido acondicionando el lugar, y se ha colocado en el gusto de sus clientes, ahora cuenta con la ayuda de sus dos hijas y desea que su negocio pueda crecer.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;En estos momentos, Jacinta necesita de un préstamo por la cantidad de $ 700 dólares que empleara en la compra de insumos que necesita para la elaboración de los alimentos que vende. Forma parte de este crecimiento y ayuda a esta familia a hacer crecer su negocio, tu puedes colaborar con esta familia, no lo dudes más.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>700</funded_amount><paid_amount>700</paid_amount><image><id>25727</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food Production/Sales</activity><sector>Food</sector><use>To buy ingredients</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Mérida, Yucatán</town><geo><level>country</level><pairs>23 -102</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T18:06:00Z</posted_date><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Jacinta</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T00:57:48Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>700</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>700</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>116.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>234</amount><local_amount>234</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:16:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>234</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23532</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>117</amount><local_amount>117</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:16:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>117</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32641</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>117</amount><local_amount>117</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:16:29Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>117</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43220</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>117</amount><local_amount>117</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:16:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>117</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55158</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>115</amount><local_amount>115</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>115</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>67943</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T00:57:48Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-16T09:16:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>7992</id><name>Rosalina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Rosalina lives in Buza area, on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam.

isn&apos;t enough to permit her to rent a dwelling. She is 38 years of age and has a business of selling sandwiches of pork at the Hernando Siles de La Paz Stadium, during professional soccer matches. She also sells her products during concerts, folkloric events and other events that take place at different venues. On ordinary days, that is to say not on holidays or Sundays, she sells by walking around the city in the company of her husband and children, her nuclear family that keeps the business moving forward since that is their only source of income. Her trust in the institution and her history of paying back should permit her to obtain a new loan.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Dwight Davis, Kiva Volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La señora Sofía  vive en casa de sus padres con su esposo e hijos (zona de Alto San Pedro de la ciudad de La Paz) pues sus ingresos no le permiten  alquilar una vivienda. Tiene 38 años de edad y se dedica a la venta de sándwich de carne de cerdo en el estadium Hernando Siles de La Paz(durante los partidos de fútbol profesional).&#13;&#10;También realiza la venta de su producto  en conciertos, entradas folklóricas  y otras actividades que convocan a varios espectadores y participantes. &#13;&#10;En días ordinarios (es decir no feriados o Domingos) realiza la venta

ingresos.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;La fidelidad con la Institución y el antecedente histórico de cumplimiento le permite acceder a un nuevo

Five years ago, shortly after the birth of her first son, family expenses increased and her husband&apos;s salary could not cover them all. So Lucía, who didn&apos;t want to neglect her baby, began selling beauty products via catalogue to her neighbors and relatives. It went well for her, since she&apos;s a good saleswoman and offered comfortable payment plans. After a little while, she decided to buy clothes with the money she had saved, and began selling that as well. Since that time, she has dedicated herself to the sale of beauty products and clothing.&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Lucía currently wishes to increase her sales, which is why she&apos;s asking for a loan of $1,200. She will repay it within two to four months, since she plans on investing this money and moving her products quickly. From her experience, she has learned the good seasons to sell her product and how to regain her investment. Lucía awaits your help to allow her business to continue to grow and help her confront the building family expenses as her children get older.&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Lucía esta casada y tiene dos hijos, uno de 6 años de edad y el otro de 2 años; hace cinco años atrás luego del nacimiento de su primer hijo, los gastos familiares se incrementaron y con el sueldo de su esposo no era suficiente para cubrir estos gastos, por lo que Lucía para no descuidar a su hijo que era un bebe, empezó ofreciendo productos de belleza por catalogo a sus familiares y  vecinos y le fue muy bien, ya que ella también es buena vendedora y los planes de pago eran cómodos para sus clientes, así con el paso del tiempo y con un pequeño capital que logró ahorrar decidió comprar ropa para venderla también y desde entonces se dedica a la venta de ropa y de artículos de belleza.&lt;p&gt;Lucía actualmente desea incrementar su negocio por lo que requiere de un préstamo por US $ 1,200 los cuales ofrece pagar en un período de 2 a 4 meses, ya que piensa invertir este dinero y darle una rotación bastante rápida a sus productos, por que ella sabe de las temporadas buenas y de cómo recuperar su inversión lo cual lo ha aprendido con la experiencia. Lucía espera su ayuda para continuar creciendo y así poder enfrentar los gastos que se incrementan a medida que sus hijos van creciendo.</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25758</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Cosmetics Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Buy beauty products and clothing.</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Saltillo, Coahuila</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>25.416667 -101</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T18:03:48Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Lucia</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T20:41:53Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>600</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>1200</amount><local_amount>1200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:16:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-06-16T09:16:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>1200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23545</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T20:41:53Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-06-16T09:16:14Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8015</id><name>Alejandrina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>My name is Alejandrina, and I sell clothing for men, women and children ages 3 and up.

She has a 20 year old son who is currently studying medicine, and a 14 year old daughter who is in middle school. Juana is separated from her husband, who does not contribute toward the payment of the family&apos;s expenses. Although she has a job in the Health Center in her hometown of Tampico, Tamaulipas, her salary does not cover the expenses of the household and her children&apos;s education. Recognizing the necessity to earn a little extra income, she decided to open her own clinic five years ago in a neighborhood very close to her home.  Little by little she has been expanding her clientele and earning the confidence of her patients. &lt;p&gt; At this time Juana needs a loan of $650 which she will use to buy a scale for weighing babies and a nebulizer, because she has lots of patients with respiratory problems. She needs your help to be able to offer better attention to her patients and to help her family. Please support her. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;Juana Marina tiene 52 años, un hijo de 20 años de edad que se encuentra estudiando la carrera de medicina y una hija de 14 años que estudia la secundaria. Actualmente Juana se encuentra separada de su esposo, quien no contribuye con los gastos de su familia. Aunque tiene un empleo en el Centro de Salud en la ciudad de Tampico, Tamaulipas, de donde son originarios, su salario no es suficiente para los gastos del hogar y de la educación de sus hijos. Por la necesidad de tener un ingreso extra ella decidió abrir su consultorio, hace cinco años, en un local en una colonia popular cerca de su domicilio, poco a poco ha estado ganando clientes y se ha ganado la confianza de sus pacientes. &lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;En estos momentos Juana necesita de un préstamo por la cantidad de $ 650 dólares que empleara en la compra de una báscula para pesar bebés y un nebulizador porque tiene muchos pacientes con problemas respiratorios. Ella necesita de tu ayuda para poder ofrecer una mejor atención a sus pacientes y ayudar a su familia, apóyala.&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>650</funded_amount><paid_amount>650</paid_amount><image><id>25777</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Health</activity><sector>Health</sector><use>Purchase of medical instruments</use><location><country_code>MX</country_code><country>Mexico</country><town>Tampico, Tamaulipas</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>22.216667 -97.85</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>16</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:53:31Z</posted_date><loan_amount>650</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Juana Marina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-27T02:57:40Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>650</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>650</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>130</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>260</amount><local_amount>260</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-16T09:16:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>260</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23551</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-16T09:16:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>32658</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-16T09:16:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43231</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>130</amount><local_amount>130</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>130</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55169</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-13T02:57:40Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-09-16T09:16:49Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>0</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8031</id><name>Patience</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Patience is 30 years and married with 2 children.

She has a small piece of land where she plants rice, corn, plantains and cacao. She also has a small business in the small town of Baba, where she sells juice, tortillas and snacks. She is applying for the loan because she wants to buy pigs that she will eventually sell as a secondary source of income. She will also invest in her land to produce rice. She has twins who are currently living in Guayaquil because they want to go to school. Clara has been trying to help them study but is having a hard time paying for their school and living expenses. Clara’s dream is to help her two sons graduate as professionals from a good school in the large city. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25798</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Pigs</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Invest in raising pigs</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-11T00:42:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Clara</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T06:18:40Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-24T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T09:15:19Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>23988</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-18T09:15:18Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33163</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-18T09:15:13Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>43864</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-18T09:15:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>55853</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-18T09:15:15Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>68795</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>110</amount><local_amount>110</local_amount><processed_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>110</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>82912</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T06:18:40Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-11-18T10:15:12Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8041</id><name>Maria Glenda</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>My business is the sale of bread, rice, frijoles, sugar, etc. to my neighbors.

of her thatched home outside Trou-du-Nord in north western Haiti. To support her large family, she has opened up two stores outside her house, situated along a small river heavily frequented by her neighbours. Joncilia runs a small candy stand as well as a clothing store. This loan will allow Joniclia to pay for transportation to the larger markets near the Dominican boarder and have capital to purchase a larger amount of clothes so she will not have to travel as frequently to replenish her inventory. She is hard-working and a well-respected member of her town. Joncilia has established a good business plan and clientele base but needs additional funding to make her businesses more self-sustainable while still supporting her seven children and saving for improving their home and their future.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Jonicilia and four other micro-entrepreneurs in her community have formed a solidarity group to receive equal shares of $400 of this $1200 loan to develop their respective businesses.

There are things that my clients ask me for that I don&apos;t have, so they go somewhere else to buy them. I would like to have a wider selection of products since the location of my business is very good for sales. If I am able to purchase all the products that I need, my sales will increase and therefore, I&apos;&apos;l have more income. I am requesting $1,000 to invest in my office supply and gift store business.&quot;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Translated from Spanish by Lighthouse Translations, Kiva

tengo en existencia, así que se van a comprarlas a otra parte, me gustaría poder tener variedad en mis productos, el lugar en donde estoy ubicado es muy bueno para las ventas si logro comprar todo lo

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;  Armando cultivates rice, watermelons, corn and soy beans on his land. He has been living in this area for about forty years. He lives with his wife and three of his sons who help him with the farming. He also lives with 4 grandchildren in his small home. He hopes to invest the loan in the preparation of his land for production and to purchase fertilizer. He is trying to save money in order to increase the size of his home for his family. &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

Luis</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt; Luis has a very small but productive rice farm. He has been living on these lands for about thirty years with his wife and family. He has raised all 8 of children with the rice production from his farm. He lives with four of his grandchildren and works hard to educate them. He will invest in fertilizer and seeds for the upcoming season. He hopes to one day fix his house and have enough saved up to rest and retire. At the moment he is still in good spirits to work and provide for his family. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

Albino</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Albino produces rice, corn, soy beans, mango and plantains. He is extremely happy to have such a productive land. He also has a few cows, chickens, pigs ,and ducks, but arecomplimentary sources of income. He makes ends meet with the profits he makes from rice production. In his home he lives with his wife, kids, some grandchildren and his mother. He will invest the loan in preparing his lands and in fertilizer. He hopes with the investments he will have more productivity from the land and to fix the roof of his home. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25836</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-11T21:38:30Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Misael Albino</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T00:14:28Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21411</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-59</amount><local_amount>-59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:48:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27062</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T19:36:53Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31797</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:29:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51898</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>513</amount><local_amount>513</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>513</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107755</payment_id><comment>PAGO DE CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T00:14:28Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T21:47:50Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8062</id><name>Maximo</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt; Maximo has been living in Baba his entire life. He has a primary education, and is a very hard worker. Through his farming he has been able to raise six children. He lives with his wife Marcia, a son and a daughter. They help him plant rice, plantains, bananas, and corn. He also raises some chickens, pigs, and cows. He hopes he can invest in a chicken coop so he can establish a business. He is optimistic about the loan because chicken sales provide a good secondary source of income in case of emergencies. With the extra profits he hopes to help pay for one of his grandchildren&apos;s university studies. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>25837</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Poultry</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Invest in a chicken coop</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-12T06:16:15Z</posted_date><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Maximo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T20:00:12Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>950</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>159</amount><local_amount>159</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>159</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21412</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>158</amount><local_amount>158</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T19:38:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>158</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31798</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>158</amount><local_amount>158</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:13:35Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>158</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51883</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>475</amount><local_amount>475</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>475</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107780</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T20:00:12Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:16:34Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8063</id><name>Elisa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Elisa has a small plot of land that she bought about 30 years ago.

The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25838</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-11T00:05:34Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Elisa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T08:36:05Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21413</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-59</amount><local_amount>-59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:49:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27064</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T19:38:52Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31799</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:26:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44801</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola</comment></payment><payment><amount>313</amount><local_amount>313</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:50:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>313</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107757</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>209418</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T08:36:05Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-13T16:13:44Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8064</id><name>Flavio</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Flavio has land mainly produces rice. He uses the land to feed his three children ages 17, 13 and 11. He and his wife work in the fields everyday hoping to have a good crop yield. He will use the loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides, and will make a small investment in land preparation. He was born and raised in Baba, but he hopes his children can gain an education and move to a bigger city. His main short term goal is to make all the lands he owns productive, as certain sectors have not been prepared for farming. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25840</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-12T06:16:29Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Flavio</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T21:25:35Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21414</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-59</amount><local_amount>-59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:50:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27065</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:29:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31800</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agricola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:10:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51879</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>513</amount><local_amount>513</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>513</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107758</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T21:25:35Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T21:51:32Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8065</id><name>Guido</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;  Guido produces rice and corn on lands given to him by his father, with also some small production of plantains.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;  Juan lives with his youngest son who is 16. Together they work their fields to plant and cultivate rice and corn. Juan is 65, but is still a very hard worker who wants to make sure he leaves his family with fertile lands. His wife passed away several years ago and he has three kids total. He hopes with the loan he make investments in preparing the fields and purchasing fertilizer.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>25844</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-12T06:17:04Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Juan</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-26T20:31:18Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>425</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-26T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>71</amount><local_amount>71</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:36Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>71</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21417</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-37</amount><local_amount>-37</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:56:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-37</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27068</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:30:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31802</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agricola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>332</amount><local_amount>332</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:58:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>332</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107763</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA BABA&#13;&#10;</comment></payment><payment><amount>25</amount><local_amount>25</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>25</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>209440</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-12T20:31:18Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-13T18:01:30Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8068</id><name>Jose</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Jose owns a small clothing store.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Gonzalo has a farm where he grows rice and corn. He lives with his wife and a son on their land and they all work on together. He admits he once was not on the right path as he drank excessively. He is now a religious man after suffering an accident where he lost an eye. He hopes to invest his money in fertilizer and seeds for the fields. He is a very hard worker who saves in order to one day send his son to college. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Victor has been living on his farm for 28 years. He plants rice and also has a small plot for cacao production. He lives with his wife, two sons, and granddaughter. He and his sons work the lands in order to feed the family. He will invest the loan to plant a new plot of rice. He will have to help his sons with the fertilizer and seeds because he is no longer able to work the fields himself. After retrieving the crop Victor does commercialize them using his years of experience in the sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25855</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T00:13:15Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Victor</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T00:26:49Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-09T22:35:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21975</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:33:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31806</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-22T17:57:39Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>45285</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agricola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>513</amount><local_amount>513</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>513</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>140962</payment_id><comment>PAGO DE CENTRO AGRICOLA DE BABA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T00:26:49Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-02-23T17:22:06Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8075</id><name>Carlos</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Carlos lives with his wife and three children, ages 20, 18 and 15.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  &#13;&#10;companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  &#13;&#10;as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Alejandro has a small plot of land where he produces rice. He has been living on this land for thirty years with his wife. He has three children ages 16, 13 and 11, all of whom are in school. He will use the loan to clean and prepare his lands in order to make them adequate for rice production. He is planning to make several improvements to his home because the floor and roof need much work. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>550</funded_amount><paid_amount>550</paid_amount><image><id>25861</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T04:43:49Z</posted_date><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Alejandro</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T15:08:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>550</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>550</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.67</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>91.65</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>92</amount><local_amount>92</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:42Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>92</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21427</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-48</amount><local_amount>-48</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T07:00:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-48</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27074</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:36:23Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31810</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>44</amount><local_amount>44</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:30:11Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>44</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51899</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>418</amount><local_amount>418</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>418</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107770</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T15:08:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:06:21Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8079</id><name>Luis</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Luis has a small piece of land given to him by an association called Voluntad Dios.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Luis lives on his farm with his wife and four children. He still has three children who are in school. He supports his family with the income from rice farming on his small, but productive farm. With the loan he receives, he hopes that he can buy machinery that will help him prepare the land he works on. His biggest goal is to be able to buy land of his own because he currently rents the land, and the farm he works on. He hopes he can acquire his own property to hand down to his children one day. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>675</funded_amount><paid_amount>675</paid_amount><image><id>25868</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-14T01:48:59Z</posted_date><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Luis</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T12:49:28Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>675</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>675</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>112.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>113</amount><local_amount>113</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:45Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>113</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21430</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-59</amount><local_amount>-59</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T07:03:06Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-59</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27081</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:40:34Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31817</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>54</amount><local_amount>54</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:26:09Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>54</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44800</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola</comment></payment><payment><amount>513</amount><local_amount>513</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>513</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107777</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T12:49:28Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:14:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8082</id><name>Anonymous</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en/></texts></description><status>refunded</status><funded_amount>0</funded_amount><image><id>726677</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Metal Shop</activity><sector>Manufacturing</sector><use>The loan will be invested in the maintenance and repair of his turning lathe and other machines.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Evaristo has been working on his farm for about 8 years. He lives with his wife and his 3 daughters, ages 10, 3 and 3 months. He relies completely on rice farming to feed his family, as his land is only productive for this activity. He was born and raised in Baba and learned to farm rice from his father. He wants to make some improvements to his home such as fixing the roof, which has a bad leak. He also wants to save for his daughters&apos; education. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Aroldo was born and raised in Baba, and has been farming rice his entire life. He lives with one of his daughters and her family. He works the land with the help of his sons who share in profits from the production. He has been living on the land for more than 60 years. He hopes that he will be able to buy fertilizer and seeds with the loan. He also wants to rent a tractor to work the land so it will be more productive. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>425</funded_amount><paid_amount>425</paid_amount><image><id>25877</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Farm Rice</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-14T01:48:52Z</posted_date><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Aroldo</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T09:26:28Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>425</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>425</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-28T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.83</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>70.85</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>71</amount><local_amount>71</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>71</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21433</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-37</amount><local_amount>-37</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T07:03:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-37</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27083</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:42:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31820</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>34</amount><local_amount>34</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:16:10Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>34</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51886</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>323</amount><local_amount>323</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>323</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107784</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T09:26:28Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:20:41Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8087</id><name>Jocqueson</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Jocqueson is an artisan who makes large baskets and bins made of bamboo strips woven together.

If a member of the group is unable to make a payment, the other members are responsible for making up the difference and helping the person to improve.

There is no electricity in the semi-rural village where Ivonne sells her products. There is a large market for candles that are used by practically everyone at night to light the rooms in their homes or light their way on the streets. The soaps she sells are in high demand as well, whether for bathing, doing laundry or the dishes. This loan will allow her to purchase large amounts of both products to expand her inventory, allow her to make fewer trips to the larger markets further away and will give her the capital she needs to invest in a stable place of business. Ivonne has been successful despite walking the crowded streets selling her wares out of a cardboard box. With this loan, her inventory will be too large to carry around and she will construct a proper stand to set up her business. Ivonne has a very soft and approachable manner that helps her gain steady clients as well as develop new ones.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Ivonne is a member of the Soleil Brillant solidarity group.

The cost of living in Haiti is such that Esperanza is able to fund 10 entrepreneurs who must make each payment together. If one person is unable to pay, the other members must make up the difference before any payment will be excepted. The community of 10 entrepreneurs have gone through Esperanza´s business training courses and have demonstrated their commitment and aptitude for receiving a loan to expand their business. Ivonne and the other members are responsible for working with one another as a social support network throughout the loan repayment and business development processes.&lt;p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25886</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Home Products Sales</activity><sector>Retail</sector><use>Purchase soaps and wax in bulk as well as materials for constructing a business stand</use><location><country_code>HT</country_code><country>Haiti</country><town>Trou-du-Nord</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>19.633333 -72.016667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>44</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T16:08:23Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Ivonne</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T10:31:05Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>partner</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-11T22:21:04Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>22325</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-03T20:52:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>28705</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-13T20:14:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>42325</payment_id></payment><payment><amount>400</amount><local_amount>400</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-25T09:19:30Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>400</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>58496</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>71763</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T10:31:05Z</funded_date><paid_date>2007-10-25T09:21:14Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8089</id><name>Luiciano</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Luiciano was born and raised in Baba, Ecuador. He has worked in rice production since he was young, after learning from his father. He bought his land about 15 years ago. He depends on his rice production to feed and educate his two children who are 6 and 7 years old. He lives with his wife, children, his father and a sister. They all work together in the fields in order to cultivate rice. He will use the loan to invest in seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. He hopes he can improve his home and save for the future of his children. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1075</funded_amount><paid_amount>1075</paid_amount><image><id>25899</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-14T01:51:58Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Luiciano</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-05-01T08:11:45Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1075</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1075</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-11-01T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.17</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2008-01-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>179.15</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>180</amount><local_amount>180</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:47Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>180</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21434</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-94</amount><local_amount>-94</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:41:08Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-94</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27055</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted. </comment></payment><payment><amount>86</amount><local_amount>86</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:44:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>86</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31821</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agr.baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>815</amount><local_amount>815</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:38:59Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>815</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107750</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment><payment><amount>11</amount><local_amount>11</local_amount><processed_date>2008-02-23T17:19:21Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>11</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>140958</payment_id><comment>PAGO DE CENTRO AGRICOLA BABA</comment></payment><payment><amount>77</amount><local_amount>77</local_amount><processed_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>77</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>211039</payment_id></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-17T08:11:45Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-05-15T19:41:26Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8090</id><name>Walter</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Walter is a plantain farmer from Baba.

The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>25902</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Invest in rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-14T16:17:43Z</posted_date><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Walter</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-29T07:34:15Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>950</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-29T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>159</amount><local_amount>159</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:48Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>159</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21435</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-83</amount><local_amount>-83</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:41:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27056</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T19:33:17Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31794</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola</comment></payment><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:25:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44799</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola</comment></payment><payment><amount>722</amount><local_amount>722</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>722</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107779</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-15T07:34:15Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:15:56Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8091</id><name>Albina</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Alvina plants rice and corn on her farm. She lives on the land with her husband and three children. She was born in Baba and has been involved in rice production for her entire life. She hopes to invest the loan in fertilizer and the rental of machinery to work the lands. She is hoping that, with the profits, she can finish constructing her home which was left incomplete. She works her part of the land on her own, with little help from her husband who has a separate plot that he rents. She works primarily to educate and feed her children. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>950</funded_amount><paid_amount>950</paid_amount><image><id>25904</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T05:59:46Z</posted_date><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Albina</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T01:46:07Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>950</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>950</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.33</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>158.35</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>159</amount><local_amount>159</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:49Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>159</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21436</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-83</amount><local_amount>-83</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T06:59:58Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-83</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27072</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:34:40Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31807</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>76</amount><local_amount>76</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:18:37Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>76</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51889</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>722</amount><local_amount>722</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>722</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107767</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T01:46:07Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:04:02Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8092</id><name>Hoa</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Miss Hoa is a poor lady, 37 years old.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Elsa lives with her husband and has five children. Her children are all grown up but two still live with her. She is also caring for a close family friend who has a brain tumor, but cannot afford medical care. With her loan she will invest in her rice production. As complimentary crops she farms cacao, mangoes and corn. She hopes that, with the loan, she will be able to invest in her land, making the soil more productive. She also wants to finish a section of her home which is still under construction. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25908</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T06:00:48Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Elsa</first_name><last_name/><gender>F</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-28T02:42:23Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-27T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:50Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21437</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-104</amount><local_amount>-104</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T07:01:33Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-104</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27076</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:37:41Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31812</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:09:25Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51878</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>912</amount><local_amount>912</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>912</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107772</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-14T02:42:23Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:11:07Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8095</id><name>Carlos Mario</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. Carlos Mario and his wife Mrs. Violeta Rodriguez have been in the cakes and jellied sweets business for 5 years. &quot;We&apos;d like to purchase more ingredients to be able to make new products given the fact that we know how to prepare a wide variety of cakes and sweets, but we cannot afford the ingredients to make them.

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Jacinto V. is one of the leaders in the rural community of Baba. He has lived in Baba his entire life and he is not only dedicated to making his farm successful, but also to helping those around him. He is a centerpiece in the Centro Agricola de Baba, which is the association that is forming the Communal Bank in the sector. As a borrower, Jacinto will invest his loan in rice farming, like most of the others in the communal bank. He will use the money to buy seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and also to rent machinery. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt; &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25910</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Rice Farming</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-13T06:00:01Z</posted_date><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Jacinto</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-30T09:16:32Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>1200</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>1200</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-30T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>200</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>200</amount><local_amount>200</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-08T09:15:51Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>200</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>21438</payment_id><comment>scheduled_repayment</comment></payment><payment><amount>-104</amount><local_amount>-104</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-30T07:02:31Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>-104</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>27079</payment_id><comment>This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted.</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-13T22:39:07Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>31815</payment_id><comment>2do pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>96</amount><local_amount>96</local_amount><processed_date>2007-09-07T19:32:27Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>96</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>51901</payment_id><comment>3er pago centro agrícola de baba</comment></payment><payment><amount>912</amount><local_amount>912</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>912</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107782</payment_id><comment>PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-16T09:16:32Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T22:19:24Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>2</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8097</id><name>Esteban</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Mr. Esteban V. began his business of making and selling polyethylene bags five months ago.  &quot;I am beginning my business of making and selling polyethylene bags using recycled materials.

Her sales are increasing as are her long trips to the larger markets outside her home city of Trou-du-Nord, Haiti. With the earnings she is making by selling her goods, she can only buy enough to last a few days before she must replenish her stock.

Previlus&apos; group will receive and pay back this loan together - if a member is unable to pay in full on time, the group is responsible for making up the deficit before a payment can be made. Investors in this loan will receive an update on Previlus&apos; situation as well as that of the entire group.

She has chosen this business so that she can sell clothing for children and adolescents, including her own. She sells her clothing to people in her neighborhood, as well as street markets on Saturdays. She would like to be able to have enough inventory to make a larger profit and continue expanding her young business. Mariette lives with her only child outside of Trou-du-Nord, a city with a large market for a small business economy. Micro-entrepreneurs like Mariette and shoppers make clothing stands like Mariette&apos;s an ideal business for growth and her professional commitment to her business makes her a great addition to Esperanza&apos;s associates.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: As with all Esperanza loan recipients in Haiti, Mariette is a member of a solidarity group, which receives and pays back equal shares of one loan.

impoverished population who mostly cook out of their homes or buy food on the street as opposed to restaurants. Celia meets a high demand with supplying these ingredients, but her kind and warm personality have helped her to be a preferred stop for many customers. She has now requested this loan from Esperanza to increase her capital so that she can reinvest in her business inventory while still having enough for savings, insurance and taking care of her four young children.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Celia is one of 10 micro-entrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza&apos;s business training courses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their shares of this $1,200 loan together.

Investors in this loan will receive an update on Celia&apos;s situation as well as that of the entire group.

She supplies families as well as other entrepreneurs whose businesses are cooking meals. They all come to Lucienne who is a respected member of her community and has demonstrated a knack for business. Lucienne works extremely hard, mainly traveling to markets to buy and sell goods at the best prices. Time on the unpaved roads using unsafe public transportation is a large reason why entrepreneurs like Lucienne come to Esperanza for a loan. She is in need of increased capital so that she can buy in larger quantities to decrease the number of trips she needs to make to the markets while having enough left over to save money for emergencies and large investments along with providing the day-to-day necessities of her six growing children.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Lucienne is a leader of her solidarity group. She and her business represent the nine other members of this group of micro-entrepreneurs, who each will receive a share of this $1,200 loan to fund their respective businesses. As members of a solidarity group, Lucienne and the other nine micro-entrepreneurs have gone through Esperanza´s business training courses and have proven to be committed to their businesses and to provide for their families. If a member of the group is unable to make a payment, the other members are responsible for making up the difference and helping the person to improve. This group-lending method creates a social support network within the community as well as an accountability system to ensure that not only are loans paid back on time, but that the loan capital is invested in developing their business and providing for the basic necessities of their families.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;</en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>1200</funded_amount><paid_amount>1200</paid_amount><image><id>25948</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Food

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;William lives on a farm where he grows rice, plantains, maize and soy beans. He is very proud of his lands, as they are very fertile and they have helped him and his family survive for years. He lives with his mother and father, and they hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

Each members will receive a share of this $1,200 loan to develop their respective businesses. The cost of living in Haiti is such that Esperanza is able to fund 10 entrepreneurs who must make each payment together. If one person is unable to pay, the other members must make up the difference before any payment will be excepted. The community of 10 entrepreneurs have gone through Esperanza´s business training courses and have demonstrated their commitment and aptitude for receiving a loan to expand their business. Ivonne and the other members are responsible for working with one another as a social support network throughout the loan repayment and business development

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Angela and her husband live on a farm in Baba, Ecuador where they cultivate rice. She has two children who are already grown up, but still live with her and help out on the farm. They have a few chickens and pigs that are their secondary sources of income. Angela hopes to invest the loan in a water pump so she may access water for her crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;

type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>&lt;p&gt;Charles has two young children that he is putting through school and taking care of thanks to the small general store that he helps run. The small store is located on the side of a major market where vendors converge twice a week to sell their wares. Charles benefits from the traffic and has one of the few structures of its size in the marketplace, which help him attract customers and his engaging personality has helped him get to where he is now.&#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, though his store is a great asset, his inventory is relatively small to what it could potentially be, given his capacity for selling and the resource he has in having a large store to house a greater amount of goods. Charles has requested this loan to increase his stock and fill his shelves so that he can be a main supplier and distributor in his town outside the city of Trou-du-Nord.

He never finished his schooling because his parents could not afford to send him away and they needed him to work. He still lives on the same land he grew up on with his mother. He hopes that he can invest in order to make the land more productive so he can support a family of his own in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Communal Banking in Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. &#13;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others&apos; guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Economy of Baba&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Rice Farming in Santa Lucia&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Access to Credit&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.&#13;&#10;Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Risks&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;h4&gt;Loan Use&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10; </en></texts></description><status>paid</status><funded_amount>825</funded_amount><paid_amount>825</paid_amount><image><id>25959</id><template_id>1</template_id></image><activity>Farming</activity><sector>Agriculture</sector><use>Jacinto would like to invest in supplies for his farm</use><location><country_code>EC</country_code><country>Ecuador</country><town>Baba</town><geo><level>town</level><pairs>-1.783333 -79.666667</pairs><type>point</type></geo></location><partner_id>7</partner_id><posted_date>2007-04-10T15:58:33Z</posted_date><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><borrowers type="list"><borrower><first_name>Jacinto</first_name><last_name/><gender>M</gender><pictured>1</pictured></borrower></borrowers><terms><disbursal_date>2007-04-25T22:32:16Z</disbursal_date><disbursal_currency>USD</disbursal_currency><disbursal_amount>825</disbursal_amount><loan_amount>825</loan_amount><local_payments type="list"><local_payment><due_date>2007-05-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-06-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-07-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-08-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-09-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment><local_payment><due_date>2007-10-25T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></local_payment></local_payments><scheduled_payments type="list"><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-07-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-08-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-09-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-10-16T07:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-11-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment><scheduled_payment><due_date>2007-12-16T08:00:00Z</due_date><amount>137.5</amount></scheduled_payment></scheduled_payments><loss_liability><nonpayment>lender</nonpayment><currency_exchange>none</currency_exchange></loss_liability></terms><payments type="list"><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-06-18T19:15:00Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>24196</payment_id><comment>1er pago asociación montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-07-20T17:02:32Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>33931</payment_id><comment>2do pago asoc montubios porgresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>66</amount><local_amount>66</local_amount><processed_date>2007-08-20T18:12:46Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>66</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>44786</payment_id><comment>3er pago montubios progresistas</comment></payment><payment><amount>627</amount><local_amount>627</local_amount><processed_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</processed_date><settlement_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</settlement_date><rounded_local_amount>627</rounded_local_amount><currency_exchange_loss_amount>0</currency_exchange_loss_amount><payment_id>107731</payment_id><comment>PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESISTAS</comment></payment></payments><funded_date>2007-04-11T22:32:16Z</funded_date><paid_date>2008-01-03T21:05:44Z</paid_date><journal_totals><entries>1</entries><bulkEntries>0</bulkEntries></journal_totals></loan><loan><id>8115</id><name>Charanai Srileap</name><description><languages type="list"><language>en</language></languages><texts><en>Srileap is 19 years old and lives with her mother (pictured here because Srileap was unavailable), her husband and two children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
